9	Patents overview	Within the US, patents are good for twenty years from the filing date of an application.  In prior times patents could claim priority to the time of the invention rather than when the application is filed.  this means that it is imperative for a patent owner to timely file a patent application to secure the priority date.  If two companies are in a race towards the development of the same product it will be especially important to file patents in a timely manner.  \r\n\r\nHow to obtain a patent, first an application is filed at the USPTO where the inventor 'claims' their invention describing it.  The patent office will then appoint an Examiner to review the patent application and compare it to the 'prior art' (work done in the past).  If the examiner thinks that the applicant's invention doesn't represent an improvement over the prior art, then he decline the patent application from being granted as a patent.  He will explain his arguments to the applicant in an 'Office Action' giving the applicant an opportunity to respond and possibly make changes to the patent application to differentiate his invention over the prior art.  At first it seems that this must be a rare occurence, but in actual practice patent applications are usually written so broadly that an office action is guaranteed.  The applicant wants the broadest claim protection possible so the additional expense of arguing with the examiner is worth it.	3
2	Navigation is better than Memorization	The MPEP is a very long and very dry book, with a lot of extranious material.  Memorizing the whole thing to pass the Patent Bar exam is not even possible, and I don't recommend.  Instead focus on memorizing a few key points, and get practice navigating the MPEP to get the answers you need.	2
3	Ok, ... Some Memorization is needed	Memorize the important elements that you really need to.	2
1	The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP).	The Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) is the examiner's handbook for examining patent, the examiner refers to it when examining patents.  It is important to know that the MPEP is not actually the law, but rather a guide and list of standard procedure for the patent examiner procedure.  Think of the MPEP as a handy interpretation and explanation of the relevant patent laws including based off of court proceedings.  Fundamentally it is a practical book that changes over time.	1
4	What is fun about studying the MPEP?	In and of itself the MPEP is boring as hell, but without soemthing more important to do..	1
5	Basic Understanding is Key	It cannot be understated how crucial a basic understanding of patents and MPEP is when taking the patent bar exam.  This basic understanding provides the framework you will need to navigate the MPEP and pass the exam successfully.  All this being said, it is my belief that in an open-book exam like the patent agent exam being able to quickly look up the exact answers is far more valuable than broad memorization.  There are a lot of hidden details that can be difficult to memorize in this exam, looking them up on the day of the exam is going to be more accurate.  In fact, I would argue too much memorization may hurt your score.  The goal is to develop an understanding of the material and to memorize key terms and concepts, referring to the MPEP for the exact details as required.	5
10	Stages of a patent -- content	First the application is filed, then the application is examined and then upon further reexamination it will possibly be allowed and issued as a Granted Patent.  The alternative is that the applicant's arguments will be wholly unsuccessful and the examiner will deny the patent forcing it to become abandoned.\r\n<div>\r\n<b> Insert Drawing</b>\r\n</div>	4
7	How to use the Navigation Quiz?	The navigation quiz is to get you familiar with the basic structure of the MPEP so that you can easily refer to it during the exam.  Not only will this save you time, but it will prevent you from making easy mistakes like using the wrong date.  \r\n\r\nFirst you will want to access the MPEP online. \r\n<a href="https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/index.html">MPEP</a>\r\n\r\nNow, feel free to search through the MPEP, but the version of the MPEP you will have during the exam only lets you search through each chapter.  It is imperative that you know what chapter to look in.  Next we will talk about the basic structure of the MPEP	7
8	Basic Structure of the MPEP	Just look at all of these chapters!   It's a lot to study, but not impossible if you use the right tools to memorize only what you need to and then look up the rest.  \r\n\r\n<li>Chapter 100 -     Secrecy, Access, National Security, and Foreign Filing</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 200 -     Types and Status of Application; Benefit and Priority Claims</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 300 -     Ownership and Assignment</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 400 -     Representative of Applicant or Owner</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 500 -     Receipt and Handling of Mail and Papers</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 600 -     Parts, Form, and Content of Application</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 700 -     Examination of Applications</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 800 -     Restriction in Applications Filed Under 35 U.S.C. 111; Double Patenting</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 900 -     Prior Art, Classification, and Search</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1000 -   Matters Decided by Various U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Officials</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1100 -   Statutory Invention Registration (SIR); Pre-Grant Publication (PGPub) and Preissuance Submissions</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1200 -   Appeal</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1300 -   Allowance and Issue</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1400 -   Correction of Patents</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1500 -   Design Patents</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1600 -   Plant Patents</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1700 -   Miscellaneous</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1800 -   Patent Cooperation Treaty</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 1900 -   Protest</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2000 -   Duty of Disclosure</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2100 -   Patentability</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2200 -   Citation of Prior Art and Ex Parte Reexamination of Patents</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2300 -   Interference and Derivation Proceedings</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2400 -   Biotechnology</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2500 -   Maintenance Fees</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2600 -   Optional Inter Partes Reexamination</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2700 -   Patent Terms and Extensions</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2800 -   Supplemental Examination</li>\r\n<li>Chapter 2900 -   International Design Applications </li>\r\n\r\nThere are some applications that really require more in-depth studying, but there are a lot (like Plant Patents) that are rarely seen on the exam.	7

13	Exceptions to 102	The applicant is permitted to have one year grace period where the inventor is allowed to disclose their invention prior to filing an application where they may disclose the invention, typically at a scientific conference, etc. On a side-note other countries often do not accept this one year grace period, so the inventor should still file an application prior to publishing.  Practically speaking it is still best practice to file an application prior to disclosing the invention, but the Grace Period is usable for US applications.	10
14	Identify Critical Items in Questions	As stated previously, the MPEP is too big to memorize (at least in one lifetime). Instead a combination of memorization and MPEP-Navigation is key.  Some memorization is needed so that you can fully understand the question and know exactly where to look up in the MPEP.  For example, the answer to a question can change based off the type of Office Action in the example.  Responding to a 102 vs a 103 rejection is going to require a different approach.  If you move too fast and don't notice these little details then you may give the right answer to the wrong question!	5
83	Enabling Prior Art	Prior art is presumed to be operable and enabling, so for a anticipation rejection, the examiner does not need to prove that the disclosure was enabling.  It is the duty of the applicant to respond and prove that the prior art is not enabling.	19
99	Brief Summary of Invention	The summary of the invention should precede the detailed description.  The summary should be directed towards the specific invention being claimed avoid mere generalities.  The subject matter of the invention should be succinctly described in the summary and should be consistent with the subject matter of the claims.	22
21	Anticipation of Ranges	Often, claims will contain ranges of values such as having a chair with between 4 and 6 legs.  A range of values, (4,5,6) will be rejected by the examiner when appropriate.  There are three situations described in the MPEP.  \r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The prior art has a specific example in the claimed range </li>\r\n<ul><li>Considering the chair example above, a suitable example would be a 4-legged chair.</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li>Conclusion:  The examiner will reject the application, saying the claims are anticipated by the prior art.</li></ul>\r\n<li>The prior art teaches a range that overlaps or touches the claimed range </li>\r\n<ul><li>Continuing our example, this could be another patent with claims directed to chairs having between 2 and 4 legs</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li>Conclusion:  The examiner <b>may</b> reject for anticipation by the prior art, but it must be determined on a case-by-case basis.</li></ul>\r\n<li>The prior art teaches a value that is close, but does not overlap or touch the claimed range. </li>\r\n<ul><li>Again with our example, this would be another patent with claims directed to chairs having between 8 and 20 legs. (That would be a weird chair!)</li></ul>\r\n<ul><li>Conclusion:  The examiner <b>cannot</b> reject the application for anticipation.</li></ul>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n(see 2131.03)	10
6	The exam contents	<div>\r\nThe exam is split into two parts, each lasting 3 hours and having 50 questions.  This gives you a little over 3 and a half minutes per question, which sounds like a lot until you see the difficulty of the questions! You will have to reference the MPEP for almost all the questions.  It is absolutely critical that you can quickly look up the information in the MPEP to stay under the time limit.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nA minimum score of 80% is required to pass the exam.  \r\n</div>	6
15	Step 1. Read the question, identify the key points.	<b>Insert Example Question here</b>\r\nThe Patent Bar exam is tricky, mainly because it is so convoluted.  The questions contain a lot of superfluous information that can trip you up.  Things to watch out for, include\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\nexact nature of the office action, 102 vs 103.  If in doubt LOOK IT UP\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nuse of NOT.  Watch out for negatives!  These are easy to trip up on.  \r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nExact nature of the claim when given.  Method vs apparatus, etc.  \r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nother key patent words like 'traverse' and 'responsive'\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>	13
16	Step 2. Read the answers	Hopefully you will be able to better understand the question in light of the answers.	13
17	Step 3. LOOK IT UP	If you understand the question at this point, you have already done half of the work.  Now, quickly look up the answers in the MPEP, and pick the appropriate answer.	13
18	Step 4. Next Question	Then, go to the next question...  Usually for exams that you have taken in the past like the SAT, GRE, LSAT etc. it is advised to skip over questions that you can't answer quickly.  I strongly suggest that you resist the urge to skip questions, because they will all be difficult to answer, and so much time is spent understanding the question and reading the answers that you will have to repeat later.  Try to answer all the questions as they come, but if a question takes more than 5-6 minutes, then I would suggest skipping it.	13
19	The Ogden Course	The Ogden course is designed to provide you with all the tools you need with none of the information you don't.  \r\n<b>The basic structure of the course</b>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\nIntroduction to Patents\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nLearning to Navigate the MPEP\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nKey content of the MPEP with quizzes\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\nPractice Exams\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>	14
12	Novelty and Anticipation?	<div>\r\nWhen you file an application, one of the things the examiner will examine is for the invention's novelty over the prior art.   Novelty should be thought of as newness, basically, has the invention be done before.  If the examiner finds relevant prior art then he can reject the patent for being 'anticipated' by the prior art.  This is a USC 102 rejection.  It is important to distinguish this type of rejection from the other types of rejections because the patent practitioner will have to tailor their response according to each invention.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nUSC 102 provides definitions and exceptions to the prior art. See section 2131 of the MPEP. \r\n</div>	10
20	Anticipation Rejections	Normally Anticipation rejections should only use a single reference to prove that the invention is not novel, but there are some circumstances that allow for multiple references to be used.  \r\n<ol>\r\n<li> (A) Prove the primary reference contains an enabled disclosure; </li>\r\n<li> (B) Explain the meaning of a term used in the primary reference; or</li>\r\n<li> (C) Show that a characteristic not disclosed in the reference is inherent.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div>\r\nBasically, the examiner can use multiple references in a supporting role to a primary reference, to illuminate the primary reference.  \r\n</div>	10
22	Secondary Considerations	'Unexpected results' and 'commercial success' are irrelevant to a Novelty rejection under USC 102.  It is important to note this, as both of these points can be used to overcome a USC 103 rejection.  Basically, if your invention has been done by someone else before, then you shouldn't receive a patent, even if you are more commercially successful or obtained some unexpected results.  \r\n\r\n(see 2131.05)	10
23	Nonanalogous or Disparaging Prior Art	A reference can still be used in a USC 102 Novelty rejection even if it explicitly 'teaches away' from the invention.  This should be understood to mean that the cited reference describes the invention (hence the novelty rejection) but then instructs the reader to not take this approach or design.  An example would be an invention of a chemical compound with 80% Sulfur and 20% Carbon.  The examiner rejects the application for anticipation over a cited reference that describes the same 80% Sulfur 20% Carbon compound, but indicates in the specification that such a compound is inferior to a 50% Sulfur 50% Carbon compound.  In this situation it does not matter that the applicant prefers the 80:20 compound, the compound is not novel, and is thus anticipated.   \r\n\r\n(see 2131.05)	10
24	Effective Filing Date	The effective filing date is determined on a claim-by-claim basis and is not determined an entire application at a time.  Under the AIA, the effective filing date is the earliest of\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) the actual filing date of the patent or the application for the patent containing the claimed invention;</li>\r\n<li>the filing date of the earliest application for which the patent or application is entitled to a right of priority for that invention.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSee MPEP 2152.01	10
85	Prior Art's Broad Disclosure still Relevant	Patents are relevant as prior art for all they contain.  “The use of patents as references is not limited to what the patentees describe as their own inventions or to the problems with which they are concerned."\r\n<b>Non Preferred and Alternative Embodiments</b>\r\n<div>\r\nEven if the prior art makes it clear that a particular embodiment is not preferred it can still be used as prior art.  This is to be contrasted with "teaching away" from the claimed invention.  \r\n</div>	19
136	Title of Invention	The title of the invention should be placed at to the top of the first page of the specification unless otherwise provided in the application data sheet.  The title should brief but technically accurate.  An examiner may require a change in title if it is not descriptive or too long.	28
27	Examination Guidelines for Determining Obviousnss	Obviousness is a legal determination, the examiner's role is as a factfinder.  The examiner's task is to identify facts regarding the state of the level of ordinary skill in the art.  As the court outlined in GRAHAM v. JOHN DEERE CO., \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) Determining the scope and content of the prior art;</li>\r\n<li>(B) Ascertaining the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art; and </li>\r\n<li> (C) Resolving the level of ordinary skill in the pertinent art. </li>\r\n</ul>	11
25	Prior art for 102	What qualifies as prior art for a novelty 102 rejection.\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Patented -- grant date of the patent is the effective date for use as prior art </li>\r\n<li>Described in a printed publication --  note, the standard for prior art is lower than the description requirements for patentability.  This means that the all the requirements for an enabling disclosure are not pertinent to a prior art described in a printed publication</li>\r\n<li>In Public Use -- Was the prior art example used by the public prior to 1 year before the effective filing date of the invention. There are two scenarios here, (1) the public use was done by a 3rd party and not the inventor and (2) the inventor made the public use of the invention.  For Scenario 1, the third party  use does not matter if it was not made available to the public.  For scenario 2 where the inventor was involved, then it may constitute a public use or sale if the inventor sells the invention (even if in secret) or discloses or allows to be used by a third party that is not under a confidentiality agreement</li>\r\n<li>On Sale - The sale or offer for sale of the invention will prevent patenting if the sales were not for experimental purposes and the invention was ready for patenting.  This does not apply to the secret sale of the invention provided there is an obligation of confidentiality to the inventor.</li>\r\n<li>Otherwise Available to the Public -- This is a 'catch-all' new under the AIA provisions.  Think of this section as describing everything not explicitly described in previous sections.  Examples include a poster at a scientific conference and a student thesis </li>\r\n<li>No Requirement of "by Others" -- The AIA does not require prior art to be done by others, so the inventor may now have his own work used as prior art against him, unless he falls under the exceptions listed in the AIA 35USC 102(b)(1)</li>\r\n<li>Admissions -- An Admission by the applicant that a previous work is prior art is considered proof that it is prior art. Such statements can be made during the prosecution of a patent, in the course of arguing with the examiner or just in the attempt to provide clarity in differentiating the invention from the prior art.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nsee MPEP 2152.02	10
26	Obviousness	In contrast to rejections based on Novelty which require a single material to be found that closely matches the claimed invention, In an obviousness rejection the examiner can combine multiple references to argue that the claimed invention should not be granted a patent.  The crux behind an obviousness argument is that the inventor is merely combining two known technologies in an entirely obvious way.  For example, replacing a copper coating on a wire with a silver coating.  The examiner could find a reference with a copper coated wire and combine it with a reference for a silver coating technique and say it is obvious to combine the two technologies.  There are arguments that the applicant can make to overcome this type of rejection.  We will get into those a little later.	11
28	Secondary Considerations	Secondary considerations must be considered for an obviousness consideration.  They include \r\n<ul>\r\n<li> Evidence of commercial success</li>\r\n<li> Long-felt but unsolved needs</li>\r\n<li> Failure of others </li>\r\n<li> Unexpected results</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThese are all very important considerations, and can be used to argue against the examiner for 103 rejections.  It is very important to remember that these arguments are unavailable in a 102 rejection.	11
29	Determining the scope and content of the prior art	The prior art used in a 103 rejection should preferably teach or suggest combining in the same ways as the claimed invention.  Although this is preferable, it is not necessary to teach or suggest to the references.	11
30	Resolving the Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art	The examiner needs to determine the level of ordinary skill in the art and apply that to the reasoning behind the combination of the references for the obviousness rejection.  The examiner himself is considered a scientific expert, so may utilize his own expertise in establishing the level of ordinary skill in the art.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) “type of problems encountered in the art;” </li>\r\n<li>(2) “prior art solutions to those problems;” </li>\r\n<li>(3) “rapidity with which innovations are made;” </li>\r\n<li>(4) “sophistication of the technology; and” </li>\r\n<li>(5) “educational level of active workers in the field."</li>\r\n</ul>	11
31	Exemplary rationales for supporting Obviousness type rejections.	<ul>\r\n    <li>(A) Combining prior art elements according to known methods to yield predictable results;</li>\r\n    <li>(B) Simple substitution of one known element for another to obtain predictable results;</li>\r\n<li>    (C) Use of known technique to improve similar devices (methods, or products) in the same way;</li>\r\n<li>    (D) Applying a known technique to a known device (method, or product) ready for improvement to yield predictable results;</li>\r\n<li>    (E) “Obvious to try” – choosing from a finite number of identified, predictable solutions, with a reasonable expectation of success;</li>\r\n<li>    (F) Known work in one field of endeavor may prompt variations of it for use in either the same field or a different one based on design incentives or other market forces if the variations are predictable to one of ordinary skill in the art;</li>\r\n<li>    (G) Some teaching, suggestion, or motivation in the prior art that would have led one of ordinary skill to modify the prior art reference or to combine prior art reference teachings to arrive at the claimed invention.</li>\r\n</ul>	11
32	Applicant's reply (Traversing the rejection)	In order to traverse the obviousness rejection , the applicant has to either (A) show that the Office erred in these findings or (B) provide other evidence to show that the claimed subject matter would have been nonobvious.  If the applicant believes the examiner has erred, then he must prove to the examiner that he has erred and not simply criticize the examiner's use of common knowledge.\r\nTo rebut a claim to combination, the applicant may make the following arguments.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>    (A) one of ordinary skill in the art could not have combined the claimed elements by known methods (e.g., due to technological difficulties);</li>\r\n<li>    (B) the elements in combination do not merely perform the function that each element performs separately; or</li>\r\n<li>    (C) the results of the claimed combination were unexpected.</li>\r\n</ul>	11
33	Content of the prior art	The content of the prior art is determined at the time the invention was made to avoid hindsight.  Basically the examiner cannot use common information after the time the invention is made to reject the claimed invention for obviousness.  Basically the same prior art is available for a 103 rejection as a 102 rejection.	11
34	Analogous and Nonanalogous art	In order for prior art to be considered analogous to the invention, and so available to be used as prior art in a 103 rejection, it has to meet one of the two following criteria.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) the reference is from the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention (even if it addresses a different problem); or </li>\r\n<li>(2) the reference is reasonably pertinent to the problem faced by the inventor (even if it is not in the same field of endeavor as the claimed invention)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nHere, 'reasonably pertinent' includes anything that "logically have commended itself to an inventor's attention in considering his problem."	11
100	Brief Description of Drawings	There should be a section that briefly describes the drawings.  This is in contrast to the more detailed description of the drawings contained in the specification.  The examiner should check to ensure there is a description for each drawing.	22
35	Differences between Prior Art and Claimed Invention	The claimed invention must be considered as whole.  The examiner cannot dissect the invention into multiple smaller parts and address each part separately.  Rather the invention must be considered in its entirety as a whole.  Same as the examiner cannot divide the invention into multiple parts, and attack each little piece, the examiner cannot overly simplify the claimed invention and compare it to the prior art.  \r\nAlso, a component of considering the subject matter as a whole lies with the discovery of a problem that the claimed invention then goes on to remedy.  This won't help the applicant if the prior art contains the same solution for a similar problem.  In any case the applicant must provide evidence of having actually discovered the source of a problem.  Inherent properties must also be included in the consideration of the claims "as a whole".  This included referencing the specification for key variables and properties.  Importantly, the prior art must also be considered in its entirety including when the prior art teaches away from the claimed invention.  When art "teaches away" it means to discourage from this technology path.	11
36	Prima Facie Obviousness	Initially the examiner has the burden of providing evidence in support of an obviousness rejection.  If the examiners does produce a prima facie case, then then the applicant bears the burden of response with additional evidence.  If the examiner does provide a prima facie case, then the applicant is under no burden to prove.	11
37	Examples of Prima Facie case of obviousness.	We need this section.  \r\n\r\nsee MPEP 2143	11
38	Supporting a rejection under 35 USC 103	see MPEP 2144	11
39	Consideration of Applicant's rebuttal arguments	see MPEP 2145	11
40	What are affidavits and declarations?	37 CFR 1.132 provides a way for an applicant to overcome a rejection by submitting affidavits or declarations.	15
41	Affidavit or Declaration showing disclosure was made by Inventor or joint inventor	Remove prior art by demonstrating that the cited prior art was published within 1 year of the filing date of the invention and that it was produced by an inventor of the filed application.   Basically you are relying upon the 'grace period' to remove this prior art as prior art. An Affidavit can also prove that the prior art was derived from material that had been previously publicly disclosed by the inventor. In that case, proof of the inventor's earlier disclosure should be submitted.   A third option showing that the disclosure was publicly disclosed by someone who had obtained the information from the inventor.	15
42	Requirements for the Affidavit or Declaration	The affidavit or declaration need not show that the disclosure was an enabling disclosure, that is irrelevant for this purposes, only the following. \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) the disclosure in question was made by the inventor or a joint inventor, or the subject matter disclosed was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor (37 CFR 1.130(a)); or </li>\r\n<li>(2) the subject matter disclosed had, before such disclosure was made or before such subject matter was effectively filed, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor (37 CFR 1.130(b)). </li> \r\n</ul>	15
43	Who may file an affidavit or declaration	The applicant or patent owner may submit an affidavit or declaration.  This can be the inventor, but may not be if the inventor has assigned ownership to another (typically his employer) and provided authority to file papers.	15
44	When an Affidavit or Declaration is not available	An affidavit is not available if the disclosure was made outside the grace period of 1 year from the filing date.  \r\n\r\nAlso, an affidavit is not available if would result in two separate parties having two patents with patentably indistinct claims.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) the patent or pending application claims an invention that is the same or substantially the same as the applicant's or patent owner's claimed invention; and </li>\r\n<li>(2) the affidavit or declaration contends that an inventor named in the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication derived the claimed invention from the inventor or a joint inventor named in the application or patent.</li>\r\n</ul>	15
45	Joint Research Agreements	35 U.S.C. 102  Conditions for patentability; novelty.\r\n\r\n<p>*****</p>\r\n\r\n    (c) COMMON OWNERSHIP UNDER JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENTS.—Subject matter disclosed and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person in applying the provisions of subsection (b)(2)(C) if—\r\n</ul>\r\n        <li>(1) the subject matter disclosed was developed and the claimed invention was made by, or on behalf of, 1 or more parties to a joint research agreement that was in effect on or before the effective filing date of the claimed invention;</li>\r\n        <li>(2) the claimed invention was made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of the joint research agreement; and</li>\r\n<li>(3) the application for patent for the claimed invention discloses or is amended to disclose the names of the parties to the joint research agreement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>*****</p>\r\n<div>\r\nFor the applicant to disqualify a disclosure as prior art, he must prove that the agreement was in place prior to disclosure.  Also the applicant must assert that the claimed invention came about as a result of the Joint Research agreement.  It is important to note that the presence of Joint Research agreement does not provide a grace period to prior disclosure before the filing of the patent application.  see 2156 last paragraph\r\n</div>	15
46	Improper Naming of Inventors	It is still important to properly name the correct inventors, even though this is emphasized less than it was prior to the AIA.  Still, in the clear event that the inventorship is incorrect, and the applicant has not filed a request to correct inventorship, then office personnel should reject the claims.	16
101	Detailed Description of Invention	This is where the person of ordinary skill in the art would read an enabling disclosure.  "The description is a dictionary for the claims and should provide clear support or antecedent basis for all terms used in the claims."	22
124	Response to examiners determination of new matter	"Where the new matter is confined to amendments to the specification, review of the examiner’s requirement for cancelation is by way of petition. But where the alleged new matter is introduced into or affects the claims, thus necessitating their rejection on this ground, the question becomes an appealable one, and should not be considered on petition even though that new matter has been introduced into the specification also. See also MPEP § 2163.06. "	25
47	35 USC 102 and 103	Applications filed before March 16, 2013 have the Pre-AIA provisions for USC 102 and 103.  \r\nApplications filed on or after March 16, 2013 have the AIA provisions for USC 102 and 103.  If the application contains a claim filed after March 16, 2013, but the other claims were filed before March 16, 2013, then the application is still an AIA application.  For example, a provisional application is filed on March 4th, 2013, then on July 7th, 2013 another provisional application claiming priority to the first was filed, with some new claims.  Initially this application is considered a Pre-AIA application, but with even a single claim filed after March 16th, 2013, this application must now comply wiht AIA 102 and 103 and pre-AIA 102(g) which pertains to the pre-AIA policy of the first inventor to invent, instead of the AIA policy of the first inventor to file.	17
86	Exception to the rule that the critical reference date must precede the filing date	References cited to show a universal fact need not be available as prior art before the applicant's filing date.  "Such facts include the characteristics and properties of a material or a scientific truism." "References which do not qualify as prior art because they postdate the claimed invention may be relied upon to show the level of ordinary skill in the art at or around the time the invention was made." "However, it is impermissible to use a later factual reference to determine whether the application is enabled or described as required under 35 U.S.C. 112(a)"\r\n<div>\r\nTax Strategies are always deemed to be within the prior art.  This is intended to keep all tax strategies within the public domain.  The exceptions to this exclusion surround the tax strategy, including financial management products and methods, and tax preparation products and methods.  The tax strategy itself will remain public domain.  \r\n</div>	19
48	Three Requirements for Specification under 35 USC 112(a)	The specification of a patent application is required to have\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) A written description of the invention;</li>\r\n<li>(B) The manner and process of making and using the invention (the enablement requirement); and</li>\r\n    <li>(C) The best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention.</li>\r\n</ul>	18
49	Purpose of USC 112	USC 112 is to ensure that the public receives a benefit from the exclusionary period granted to a patent owner.  The patent is required to show that the inventor actually knew how to make the invention, and enables the public to understand how to make the invention as well as disclose the best way to make the invention.	18
102	Mode of Operation of Invention	The applicant should disclose what they believe to be the best mode for  carrying out the invention at the time of filing.  This is not intended to be a production specification, and it is understood that a best mode may change when the product is actually taken to market.  The applicant is still required to disclose what they believe to be the best mode.	22
126	IDS cont.	The Examiner is obligated to consider the information in an IDS, once the minimum IDS requirements are met.  These requirements follow\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) in compliance with the content requirements of 37 CFR 1.98, and </li>\r\n<li>(2) filed in accordance with the procedural requirements of 37 CFR 1.97.</li>\r\n</ul>	26
131	Timing Requirements for an IDS	An information disclosure statement will be considered by the examiner if filed within any one of the following time periods:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>    (A) for national applications (not including CPAs), within three months of the filing date of the national application or before the mailing date of a first Office action on the merits;</li>\r\n<li>    (B) for international applications, within three months of the date of entry of the national stage as set forth in 37 CFR 1.491 or before the mailing date of a first Office action on the merits;</li>\r\n<li>    (C) for RCEs and CPAs, before the mailing date of a first Office action on the merits; or</li>\r\n<li>    (D) for international design applications, within three months of the date of publication of the international registration under Hague Agreement Article 10(3) or before first Office action on the merits, whichever is later</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nAn information disclosure statement filed within one of these periods requires neither a fee nor a statement under 37 CFR 1.97(e).\r\n<b>Bunch more Information.  Need to go through this</b>	26
137	Applicant	"Effective September 16, 2012, the Office revised the rules of practice to permit a person to whom the inventor has assigned or is under an obligation to assign an invention to file and prosecute an application for patent as the applicant, and to permit a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter to file and prosecute an application for patent as the applicant on behalf of the inventor. See MPEP § 605.01 for information regarding the applicant in applications filed on or after September 16, 2012.\r\n\r\nFor applications filed before September 16, 2012, a person to whom the inventor assigned an invention could file and prosecute an application for patent, but the inventor is considered the applicant. See MPEP § 605.02 for information regarding the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012"	29
50	More details on satisfying 112	The written description needs to be written with the person of ordinary skill in the art in mind.  If the person of ordinary skill in the art could not read the description and understand the product in light of the specified manufacturing process in the specification.  Said more plainly, if the person of ordinary skill in the art cannot read how to make the product and what the result is, then the description is insufficient.  Also, an invention that solely describes a method of making would not be able to justify a grant for the product produced.  There could be sufficient support for the method claims, but insufficient support for any product claims.   This situation may arise when the product produced by this method is not unique to this method.\r\n<div>\r\nThere must be support in the specification for each of the claims, this is the written description requirement.  \r\n<p>"While there is no in haec verba requirement, newly added claims or claim limitations must be supported in the specification through express, implicit, or inherent disclosure. An amendment to correct an obvious error does not constitute new matter where the ordinary artisan would not only recognize the existence of the error in the specification, but also recognize the appropriate correction."\r\n</p>\r\n<p>"The fundamental factual inquiry is whether the specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed."</p>\r\n</div>	18
53	Enablement Requirement	The purpose of the enablement requirement is to ensure the specification describes how to make and use the invention.  The goal is to teach a person of ordinary skill in the art how to make and use the invention.  It is important to note that the enablement requirement and the written description requirement are separate and distinct.  \r\n<div> \r\n<b>criteria of enablement</b>\r\nundue experimentation\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) The breadth of the claims; </li>\r\n<li>(B) The nature of the invention;</li>\r\n<li>(C) The state of the prior art;</li>\r\n<li>(D) The level of one of ordinary skill;</li>\r\n<li>(E) The level of predictability in the art;</li>\r\n<li>(F) The amount of direction provided by the inventor;</li>\r\n<li>(G) The existence of working examples; and </li>\r\n<li>(H) The quantity of experimentation needed to make or use the invention based on the content of the disclosure.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAll of these factors must be considered, a rejection cannot be based on only one of the factors without consideration for the others.  The specification must also disclose at least one method for making and and at least one method of using the invention to satisfy the enablement requirement.  \r\n</div>	18
87	Drawings as Prior Art	Drawings can be used as prior art in anticipation rejections if they clearly show the structure as claimed.	19
54	Enablement Requirement -- Working Example	<div>\r\nThere are prophetic examples, which may not have actually been completed and there are working examples which have actually been performed.  It is not necessary to have a working example to file a patent application, but a lack of working example is considered when determining the satisfaction of the enablement requirement.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nAn application lacking working examples may not be rejected for lack of enablement outright if all the other factors point towards enablement.  If the other factors also do not point towards enablement then, the application may be rejected for lack of enablement.  Only having one working example also cannot be the sole reason for rejecting claims seen as broader than that example.  The examiner would also need to assert, upon evaluation of the facts and evidence, that the scope of the claims could not be extrapolated from the single working example. \r\n</div>	18
51	The Examiner's methodology for adequacy of written description	It is presumed that a filed patent application has an adequate written description.  It is the Examiner's burden to prove otherwise upon reading the contents of the application.  The examiner must identify the claim limitations that are not adequately supported.  The examiner should first determine exactly what the claim covers through careful reading of the claim and then carefully read the application to understand how (and if) the specification supports the claim.  \r\n<div>\r\nImportant the written description is needed to show possession of the invention.  \r\n</div>	18
52	Common situations where adequate written description issues arise.	<ul>\r\n<li>I. AMENDMENT AFFECTING A CLAIM</li>\r\n<li>II. RELIANCE ON FILING DATE OF PARENT APPLICATION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 120</li>\r\n<li>III. RELIANCE ON PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. 119</li>\r\n<li>IV. SUPPORT FOR A CLAIM CORRESPONDING TO A COUNT IN AN INTERFERENCE</li>\r\n<li>V. ORIGINAL CLAIM NOT SUFFICIENTLY DESCRIBED</li>\r\n<li>VI. INDEFINITENESS REJECTION OF A MEANS- (OR STEP-) PLUS-FUNCTION LIMITATION</li>\r\n</ul>	18
103	Claims	The specification must conclude with claims that particularly and distinctly point out the subject matter of the invention.	22
128	IDS in Continued Examinations or Continuing Applications	When filing a continuing application it is not necessary for the applicant to file an IDS in the continuing application citing the prior art cited by the examiner in the parent application.  This is true for applications other than an international application.  \r\n<b>see 609.02(II)</b>	26
132	Noncomplying IDS	If an information disclosure statement does not comply with the requirements based on the time of filing of the IDS as discussed in MPEP § 609.04(b), including the requirements for fees and/or statement under 37 CFR 1.97(e), the IDS will be placed in the application file, but none of the information will be considered by the examiner. \r\n<div>\r\nThe examiner should write “not considered” on an information disclosure statement where none of the information listed complies with the requirements.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nComplying IDS...\r\n</div>	26
55	Best Mode Requirement	The applicant is required to disclose the best mode of their invention.  The motivation behind this is to protect against the applicant obtaining patent protection without fully disclosing their invention.  The applicant may disclose the second-best embodiment, but leave out the preferred embodiment.  This would violate the best mode requirement.  Interestingly enough, the best mode was often (pre-AIA) used as a basis to invalidate a patent, but the changes made in AIA make it impossible to invalidate based off failure to disclose best mode.\r\n<div>\r\nConsiderations\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I. DETERMINE WHAT IS THE INVENTION</li>\r\n<li>II. SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS NOT REQUIRED</li>\r\n<li>III. DESIGNATION AS BEST MODE IS NOT REQUIRED</li>\r\n<li>IV. UPDATING BEST MODE IS NOT REQUIRED </li>\r\n<li>V. DEFECT IN BEST MODE CANNOT BE CURED BY NEW MATTER</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe examiner can reject based off lack of best mode disclosure.  The examiner must assume the best mode is disclosed, unless there is evidence to the contrary.  As you can imagine, this is a rare occurrence.   In the event that it does happen, the examiner must determine if the at the time the application was filed, that there was a mode considered to be better than the others by the inventors.  Then the examiner must compare that best mode with what was disclosed in the specification.  \r\n</div>	18
56	Other Requirements of 35 USC 112	There are two more separate requirements in 35 USC 112.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(A) the claims must set forth the subject matter that the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention; and </li>\r\n<li>(B) the claims must particularly point out and distinctly define the metes and bounds of the subject matter to be protected by the patent grant. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div>\r\nPart A is just a subjective understanding of the invention.  Part B is more important, it objectively requires that the claims of the patent be definite, which means they are clear to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  The claims should be precise, clear, correct, and unambiguous.  Determining if the claims are definite is a necessary component of the examination process as well as the novel and nonobvious requirements.  \r\n</div>	18
57	Part A Subject matter the inventor regards as the invention.	The examiner may reject the application based off of an inventor statement somewhere other than in the application that the actual invention is different from the claimed invention.  The examiner is required to have this evidence though, because a patent is presumed to be appropriately claimed.  A shift in the claims is permitted.  The applicant may alter the claims in subsequently filed applications after the first application.  \r\n<div>\r\nA claim cannot omit matter disclosed to be essential matter as described in the specification.  This should be rejected.  \r\n</div>	18
58	Part B Claims must Particularly Point Out and Distinctly Claim the Invention	This section is about definiteness rejections.  The applicant is their own lexicographer, being able to define terms in the specification.  The claims should be read with the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claims.  Under this interpretation words are given their plain meaning unless defined otherwise in the specification.  It is good practice for a practitioner to define terms within a specification, especially where there may be confusion otherwise.  \r\n<div>\r\n"a claim is indefinite when the boundaries of the protected subject matter are not clearly delineated and the scope is unclear".\r\n\r\nA broad claim is not necessarily indefinite.  The examiner's focus during examination.   \r\n"If the language of the claim is such that a person of ordinary skill in the art could not interpret the metes and bounds of the claim so as to understand how to avoid infringement, a rejection of the claim under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, second paragraph, is appropriate."\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe applicant should make the meaning of every term apparent to avoid an indefiniteness rejection.  Any terms used contrary to their normal meaning should be clearly redefined.  Also new terms may be coined to suit the applicant, provided they are defined in the specification.  \r\n<b> Relative Terminology </b>\r\nTerms of degree may be considered definite if they provide enough certaininty to one of skill in the art.  The specification should provide examples which can be used to measure a degree even when the actual numerical measurements are not present or possible.  The applicant may respond to a indefiniteness rejection basedThe addition of the word “type” to an otherwise definite expression (e.g., Friedel-Crafts catalyst) extends the scope of the expression so as to render it indefinite. off the terms of degree by arguing that a person of ordinary skill in the art could ascertain the meaning of the term of degree when reading the disclosure.  When the scope of the claim is unclear an indefinitenss rejection is proper.  \r\n<div>\r\nA claim containing a reference to a variable object may render the claim indefinite.  A variable object could be the height of a person that is undefined.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nApproximations\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>About</li>\r\nNeeds to be understood as it relates to the prior art and the specification.  In some cases the courts have the found "about" to be definite, but in other cases the use of the word "about" has been grounds for indefiniteness.  In this case the courts looked for specific activity within the specification, prosecution history or the prior art to lend meaning to describe what is meant by "about".  \r\n<li>Essentially</li>\r\nEssentially was held to be definite when it was used to describe a "a silicon dioxide source that is essentially free of alkali metal".  Here it was understood that the applicant was admitting to the possible presence of unavoidable impurities in the source material.  A person of ordinary skill in the art would be able to understand this.  \r\n<li>Similar</li>\r\nSimilar has been regarded as indefinite, since it is unclear what would qualify as similar.  \r\n<li>Substantially</li>\r\nSubstantially is a broad term and has been held up as definite in view of the specification and the level of skill of the ordinary person in the art.  \r\n<li>Type</li>\r\n"The addition of the word “type” to an otherwise definite expression (e.g., Friedel-Crafts catalyst) extends the scope of the expression so as to render it indefinite."\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\nSubjective terms in a claim will render it indefinite unless the specification provides objective measures to define the subjective term.  The applicant can respond to such a rejection by amending the claim or proving that the meaning of the term can be ascertained by one of ordinary skill in the art.  Importantly, merely providing examples will not overcome the indefiniteness rejection.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<b> Numerical Ranges and Amounts Limitations</b>\r\nBy and large the recitation of numerical ranges will not have an effect on whether a claim is definite.  If it is confusing and contradictory, such as conflicting statements in the same claim on the preferred value within the claimed range, then it should be rejected for indefiniteness.  This is not an issue for a dependent claim providing a more narrow preferred range to the claim it is dependent upon.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n"Open-ended numerical ranges should be carefully analyzed for definiteness. For example, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% sodium” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of nonsodium ingredients which add up to 100%, apparently to the exclusion of sodium, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation (unless the percentages of the nonsodium ingredients are based on the weight of the nonsodium ingredients)."\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n"Effective Amount" may or may not be indefinite depending on whether a person of ordinary skill in the art could understand the meaning in light of the specification\r\n</div>	18
61	Part B Alternative Limitations	<b>Markush Groups</b>\r\n<div>\r\n A markush claim is one that lists a group of alternatives within the claim. For example, “a material selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C” or “wherein the material is A, B, or C”.  These types of claims should not necessarily be rejected for indefiniteness, unless they are so expansive as to to be confusing to a person of ordinary skill in the art.  \r\n</div>	18
59	Part B continued	<b>Exemplary Claim language</b>\r\n<div>\r\nThese are the phrases "such as" and "for example" etc.  Although their mere presence does not justify rejecting a claim for indefiniteness, they are indicative of the applicant providing examples in a claim where such examples should be placed in the specification.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b> Lack of Antecedent Basis </b>\r\n<div>\r\nRejections for indefiniteness for lack of antecedent basis are fairly common, though avoidable.  Basically, the applicant is referring to an object in a claim, when that object was not adequately defined earlier in the claim.  For example, there are to levers described in Claim 1.  In dependent claim 2, it says that "said lever" is green without specifying which of the two lever is "said lever".  This problem is easily corrected.  \r\n</div>	18
60	Part B Functional Limitations	"A claim term is functional when it recites a feature “by what it does rather than by what it is” (e.g., as evidenced by its specific structure or specific ingredients)."\r\n  A functional term will not automatically render a claim indefinite, although it may.  As with other claim limitations, a functional limitation must be understood within the context of a person of ordinary skill in the art.  A common example phrasing would be "operatively connected", which is generally permissible.  The primary inquiry for functional claim language is whether the language leaves room in the claim for ambiguity or whether the boundaries are clear and precise.  Again, the claims must be read in the context of the specification and the person of ordinary skill in the art.	18
88	Availability of a document as a "patent"	Just because a patent is called as such does not mean it is available as "patent" prior art in a rejection.  A secret patent is not available as a reference until it is available to the public.  The date of availability of a patent as a reference is usually the date the patent rights are formally awarded to its applicant.  The scope of reference's disclosure when the reference is classified as a "patent" and not "publication" includes the specification and not just the claims.	21
112	Rejection and Objection to Improper dependent claims	If the base claim has been canceled, a claim which is directly or indirectly dependent thereon should be rejected as incomplete. If the base claim is rejected, the dependent claim should be objected to rather than rejected, if it is otherwise allowable.\r\n\r\nForm paragraph 7.43 can be used to state the objection.	22
129	Information Disclosure Statements in National Stage Applications	The examiner will consider the documents cited in the international search report in a PCT national stage when the appropriate form is submitted.	26
133	Basic Filing, Search and Examination Fees	<ul>\r\n<li> Non-Provisional Application</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Basic Filing Fee</li>\r\n<li>Search Fee</li>\r\n<li>Application size fee</li>\r\n<li>All these fees may be paid for specified period after filing with the appropriate surcharges</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li> Provisional Application</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Basic Filing fee (can be paid later, with appropriate surcharges)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>International Applications entering the national stage</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>see 37 CFR 1.492</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>	27
63	Basic process for the examiner	The examiner should review all the claims for compliance with every statutory requirement within the first office action.  Then the applicant's response may correct all such problems at once.  \r\n<div>\r\nThe examiner should look for Utility of the invention.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nReview the detailed disclosure and embodiments of the invention.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nReview the Claims\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThen the examiner must conduct a search of the prior art.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nDetermine whether the the claimed invention complies with 35 USC 101.  The four requirements follow,\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(i) only one patent may be obtained for an invention;</li>\r\n<li>(ii) the inventor(s) must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012 or must be the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012;</li>\r\n<li>(iii) the claimed invention must be eligible for patenting; and,</li>\r\n<li>(iv) the claimed invention must be useful. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nEvaluate compliance with 35 USC 112(b) and then evaluate for compliance with 35 USC 112(a)\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nEvaluate whether the claimed invention complies with 35 USC 102 and 103.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nFinally, the Examiner must communicate their findings, conclusions and their bases.  \r\n</div>	8
62	Part B  continued	<b>Negative Limitations</b>\r\n<div>\r\nNegative limitations are acceptable provided they distinctly and particularly point out what the inventors invented, rather than point out what they did not invent.  Negative limitations must have a basis in the specification.  They may make the claims indefinite.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Multiplicity</b>\r\n<div>\r\nA multiplicity rejection should be rarely used.  It is intended for the situation where the applicant has an unreasonable number of claims which are repetitious and multiplied.  The result being confusion.  In this case, the examiner should conduct a phone interview with the applicant to ask them to select the claims they wish to have examined. \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Double Inclusion</b>\r\n<div>\r\nsee 2173.05(o)\r\n</div>\r\n<b>"Product-by-Process" and "Product and Process"</b>\r\n<div>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>"A product-by-process claim which defines the claimed product in terms of the process by which it is made, is proper"</li>\r\n<li>A product and process claim (ie a single claim with both a product and a process) is indefinite.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Use Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\nUse claims are claims directed towards a process without providing any steps in that process.  They are often phrased as "a process for using ... to accomplish X".  All the critical pieces of information are missing from this claim.  Use claims should be rejected under 35 USC 112 for indefiniteness and 35 USC 101 for being an improper process claim.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Omnibus Claim</b>\r\n<div>\r\nAn Omnibus claim reads as "A device substantially as shown and described".  this should be rejected as being indefinite.  These types of claims are used by applicant's during prosecution when they have not yet invested the time into drafting proper claims and simply wish to secure a filing date ahead of some Office deadline.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Reference to Figures or Tables</b>\r\n<div>\r\nReferencing a figure or table is generally considered improper, although not if it is absolutely necessary since it is practically impossible to define the invention in words alone.\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Chemical Formula</b>\r\n<div>\r\nGenerally, chemical formulas and the names thereof are considered definite.  \r\n"A compound may also be claimed in terms of the process by which it is made without raising an issue of indefiniteness. "\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Trademarks in Claim</b>\r\n<div>\r\nGenerally trademarks should not be included in the claim, although not necessarily grounds for a rejection for indefiniteness, they can be.  At the very least their presence is unnecessary.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b> Mere Function of a Machine</b>\r\n<div>\r\nA claim reciting the method of operation for a machine is not indefinite even if the machine as described as an apparatus is only capable of carrying out said steps.  \r\n</div>	18
65	Patent eligible subject matter-living subject matter	Living subject matter may be directed to a statutory category such in 35 USC 101 (ie. "manufacture or "composition of matter").  The eligibility of living subject matter is dependent upon the claimed living matter being "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature".  There is a specific exception mandating that human organisms are nonstatutory subject matter and so ineligible for patenting.	9
64	35 USC 101 Inventions Patentable	<ul>\r\n    <li>i) only one patent may be obtained for an invention;</li>\r\nNo double patenting\r\n    <li>(ii) the inventor(s) must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012 or must be the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012;</li>\r\n    <li>(iii) the claimed invention must be eligible for patenting; and,</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>"(a) first, a claimed invention must fall within one of the four statutory categories of invention, i.e., process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter; and"</li>\r\n<li>"(b) second, a claimed invention must be directed to patent-eligible subject matter and not a judicial exception (unless the claim as a whole includes additional limitations amounting to significantly more than the exception)"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n    <li>(iv) the claimed invention must be useful.</li>\r\n</ul>	9
66	Patent Subject Matter Eligibility	There are two criteria for subject matter eligibility,\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>One of the four categories of inventions</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Processes</li>\r\n<li>Machines</li>\r\n<li>Manufactures</li>\r\n<li>Compositions of Matter</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>The claimed invention must be patent eligible subject matter</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nJust because a claim includes a judicial exception does not mean that the claim is directed towards ineligible subject matter if the claim is directed towards the application of an abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon.  The Alice/Mayo test is used to distinguish between the two.  \r\nThe first step is to properly establish the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim as a whole.  <b>An overview of the process is in MPEP 2106</b>	9
76	Inherency rejections	Something which is old does not become patentable upon the discovery of a new property.  The inherent feature need not be recognized at the time of the invention.  Basically inherency is when the applicant attempts to patent a known product with a previously unknown characteristic.  The examiner's argument is that this property was inherent in the original invention, and so rejects the patent.  Here it is important that the prior art product seem to be identical aside from the newly claimed feature (on which it is silent).  An optimization of an old recipe to reveal new properties does not justify an inherency rejection.  “In relying upon the theory of inherency, the examiner must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning to reasonably support the determination that the allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily flows from the teachings of the applied prior art.”  After the examiner's rejection, the burden is on the applicant to produce counter-arguments and evidence.	20
77	Inherency in Composition, Product, and  Apparatus Claims and Process Claims	<b>Product and Apparatus Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\n"Where the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established."\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Composition Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\nIf the composition is physically the same, it must have the same properties.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Product Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\nNonfunctional printed matter does not distinguish claimed product from otherwise identical prior art product.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b> Process Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\nPrior art device anticipates a claimed process if the device carries out the process during normal operation.\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Process of Use Claims</b>\r\n<div>\r\nA process of use claim may be patentable for an old structure.  It cannot though, if the old composition or structure and the use is directed to a result or property of that old structure.  \r\n</div>	20
98	Background of the Invention	The background of the invention may, (but is not required to) include the following parts:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>(1) Field of the Invention</li>\r\n<li>(2) Description of the related art (to help the applicant distinguish themselves from the prior art)</li>\r\n</ul>	22
134	Application Size Fee	The application size fees is for patent application exceeding 100 pages.	27
67	Step 1: the Four categories of statutory subject matter	<b>Process</b>\r\n<div>\r\nA process claim (or a method claim) defines actions and is an act or a series of acts.  It is fairly obvious.  \r\n</div>\r\n<b>Machines, Manufactures and Compositions of Matter</b>\r\n<div>\r\nThese types of claims all refer to physical objects.  It is not necessary to categorize each claim into one of the above categories.  They are only required to be defined by at least one of them.  A machine is a “concrete thing, consisting of parts, or of certain devices and combination of devices.”  A manufacture is “a tangible article that is given a new form, quality, property, or combination through man-made or artificial means.” A composition of matter is a “combination of two or more substances and includes all composite articles.”\r\n"Non-limiting examples of claims that are not directed to any of the statutory categories include:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>    Products that do not have a physical or tangible form, such as information (often referred to as “data per se”) or a computer program per se (often referred to as “software per se”) when claimed as a product without any structural recitations;</li>\r\n<li>    Transitory forms of signal transmission (often referred to as “signals per se”), such as a propagating electrical or electromagnetic signal or carrier wave; and</li>\r\n<li>     Subject matter that the statute expressly prohibits from being patented, such as humans per se, which are excluded under The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public Law 112-29, sec. 33, 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n"\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nIf a claim does not fit into the above categories then it must be rejected under 35 USC 101.  \r\n</div>	9
68	Judicial Exceptions	<b>There is a bunch of material here</b>	9
69	Utility Requirement	<b>Bunch of material here</b>	9
70	Broadest Reasonable Interpretation	Claims must be given their broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the specification during prosecution.  The claims of a granted patent are evaluated differently in the courts, this understanding is developed within the context of the prosecution record as well.  The goal of using the broadest reasonable interpretation is to prevent the granted claims from being more broad than the prosecuted claims.  Here, by definition the prosecuted claims are as broad as they will ever be.  It is important to note that the broadest reasonable interpretation is distinct from the broadest possible interpretation.  The examiner must interpret the claims with the understanding of one of ordinary skill in the art.	19
71	Plain Meaning of Claim Language	Unless there is a different definition of the term in the specification, every term shall be understood with the plain meaning of the term.  Plain meaning should be the understanding of the term of a person of ordinary skill in the art.  The applicant is their own lexicographer and may redefine terms as they see fit in the specification.  When looking to the specification it is important not to import limitations from the specification into the claims.  A method described in the specification, but expressed more broadly in the claims, should be understood in the broader context of the claims.	19
73	Transitional Phrases	<ul>\r\n<li>Comprising</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Synonymous with "including", "containing" and "characterized by"</li>\r\n<li>Inclusive or open-ended, it does not exclude unrecited elements.  There may be additional elements to the that are present beyond the claim here.  This is not an exhaustive list.  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Consisting of</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>closed ended, excludes any element step or ingredient not specified in the claim</li>\r\n<li>used with Markush type claims</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Consisting Essentially of</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Intermediary between closed ended and open ended. </li>\r\n<li>'The transitional phrase “consisting essentially of” limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps “and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s)” of the claimed invention.'</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<li>Other Transitional phrases</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>"having", "composed of", must be interpreted on a case-by-case basis to determine if it open or closed</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</ul>	19
72	Effect of Preamble	A preamble may or may not provide limits to a claim.  It is decided on a case-by-case basis.  If the preamble statements limit the structure of the claimed invention then that limitation is considered a claim limitation.  For preamble statements that recite the purpose or intended use of the claimed invention, it will not have any limitation upon the claim if it truly is just for the purpose or intended use of the claimed invention.  If the preamble statements pertaining to the purpose or intended use would result in a structural difference then the preamble would limit the claim.	19
74	“Adapted to,” “Adapted for,” “Wherein,” “Whereby,” and Contingent Clauses	“Adapted to,” “Adapted for,” “Wherein,” “Whereby,” may or may not indicate a claim limitation.  It must be determined on a case-by-case basis.  \r\n<b>Contingent Limitations</b>\r\n<div>\r\nImagine a method claim with two possible submethods depending upon a particular condition.  If condition 1 then sub-method 1, if condition 2, then submethod 2.  This is a contingent claim limitation.  The broadest reasonable interpretation remains the standard for comprehending these claims.  If one or all claim limitations are required given the conditions under the broadest reasonable interpretation, then those limitations are required.  \r\n</div>	19
75	Functional and Nonfunctional Descriptive Material	Printed matter in a claim may or may not be given patentable weight according to the whether the printed matter has a functional relationship with the physical substrate of the printed matter.	19
78	Product By Process Claims	Product by process claims are not limited to the manipulations of the recited steps, only the structure implied by the steps.  If the same product is in the prior art then the new claimed invention cannot be allowed even though it was made by a different process.	19
79	Apparatus and Article Claims -- Functional Language	Inherency and functional limitations.  If an examiner concludes that a functional limitation is an inherent characteristic of the prior art, then to establish a prima case of anticipation or obviousness, the examiner should explain that the prior art structure inherently possesses the functionally defined limitations of the claimed apparatus.II. MANNER OF OPERATING THE DEVICE DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE APPARATUS CLAIM FROM THE PRIOR ART III. A PRIOR ART DEVICE CAN PERFORM ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE APPARATUS CLAIM AND STILL NOT ANTICIPATE THE CLAIM IV. DETERMINING WHETHER A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM LIMITATION IS PATENTABLE OVER THE PRIOR ART UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103	19
80	Material or article worked upon	For an apparatus claim the article worked upon will not make the apparatus patentable, if the apparatus itself is not patentable.	19
81	title	"All the limitations of a claim must be considered when weighing the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art in determining the obviousness of a process or method claim"	19
82	Markush Claims	A markush claim recites a list of alternatively usable members.	19
84	Utility in the Prior Art	Utility does not need to discussed in the prior art.	19
89	Domestic and Foreign Patent Applications as Prior Art	Abandoned applications including provisional applications can be used as prior art only if cited elsewhere as part of another patent's disclosure.  They become available as prior art only as of the date the public gains access to it.  \r\n<div>\r\nCanceled matter in the application file of a U.S. patent cannot be relied upon in a rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e). Ex Parte Stalego, 154 USPQ 52, 53 (Bd. App. 1966). The canceled matter only becomes available as prior art as of the date the application issues into a patent since this is the date the application file history becomes available to the public. In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967). However, as discussed below, such matter may be available as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b). For more information on available prior art for use in pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e) rejections see MPEP § 2136.02. For more information on available prior art for use in 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) rejections see MPEP § 2154et seq.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nFigures that had been canceled from a Canadian patent application before issuance of the patent were available as prior art under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b) as of the date the application became publicly accessible. The patent at issue and its underlying application were available for public inspection at the Canadian Patent Office more than one year before the effective filing date of the patents in suit. Bruckelmyer v. Ground Heaters, Inc., 445 F.3d 1374, 78 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2006). \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nLaid Open Applications May Constitute “Published” Documents\r\n\r\nWhen the specification is not issued in printed form but is announced in an official journal and anyone can inspect or obtain copies, it is sufficiently accessible to the public to constitute a “publication” within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(1) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and (b). See In re Wyer, 655 F.2d 221, 210 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1981). \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nAs specified in 37 CFR 1.14(a), all pending U.S. applications are preserved in confidence except for published applications (see also 35 U.S.C. 122(b)), reissue applications, and applications in which a request to open the complete application to inspection by the public has been granted by the Office (37 CFR 1.11(b)). However, if an application that has not been published has an assignee or inventor in common with the application being examined, a rejection will be proper in some circumstances. For instance, when the claims between the two applications are not independent or distinct, a provisional double patenting rejection is made. See MPEP § 804. If the copending applications differ by at least one inventor and at least one of the applications would have been obvious in view of the other, a provisional rejection over 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) or 35 U.S.C. 102(e) or 35 U.S.C. 103 is made when appropriate. See MPEP § 706.02(f)(2), § 706.02(k), § 706.02(l)(1), § 706.02(l)(3) and § 2154. \r\n</div>	21
90	"Printed Publications" as Prior Art	A reference is a "printed publication" if is available to the public.  An electronic publication is considered to be a "printed publication" provided that the publication was available to the people of the art.  The date of availability is the publication date or date of public post of the document.  Without such a date, the material cannot be relied upon as prior art.  The prior art can be relied upon for what it would have instructed a person of ordinary skill in the art like any other document.  Interestingly enough, the examiner only needs to prove that the document was publicly available not that it was actually read by anyone.  \r\n<div>\r\nLevel of Public Accessibility Required.  \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A thesis place in a university library may be prior art.  The issue is that the people of the art would know of and have access to the work</li>\r\n<li>Orally presented paper can constitute a "printed publication" if written copies are available without restriction</li>\r\n<li>Internal documents intended to be confidential are not "printed publications"</li>\r\n<li>Publicly displayed documents can constitute a "printed publication" even if the duration of display is for only a few days and the documents are not disseminated by copies or indexed in a library or database</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nDate of publication can be the date that the journal was received by a member of the public.  Also the date of accessibility can be shown in the absence of an official publication date, with the description of routine business practices.  \r\n</div>	21
91	Admissions as prior art	Did I do this section???	21
92	Disclosure	A patent application must contain a full and clear disclosure of the invention to satisfy 35 USC 112(a).  The requirement for an adequate disclosure is to ensure the public receives something in exchange for the exclusionary rights granted to the patent owner.  No new matter may be introduced into an application after its filing date.	22
93	The Specification	The specification is a written description of the invention and of the manner and process of making and using the same.  The specification is giant block of text that fully describes and elaborates on the invention.  This is in contrast to the claims which describe the invention in a single sentence.  The specification must commence on a separate sheet.	22
94	Details on the Specification	All applicants should use the metric system in patent dimensions followed by the English units if desired.  If a an application meets the standards of 35 USC 111(a) or a provisional application meets 35 USC 111(b) then the application will be accorded a filing date, even if it is not in English.  \r\n<div>\r\n"If a nonprovisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) is filed in a language other than English, an English translation of the non-English language papers, a statement that the translation is accurate, the fees set forth in 37 CFR 1.16, the oath or declaration and fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(i) should either accompany the nonprovisional application papers or be filed in the Office within the time set by the Office. If a provisional application is filed in a language other than English, an English translation of the non-English language provisional application and a statement that the translation is accurate must be submitted if benefit of the provisional application is claimed in a later-filed nonprovisional application (see 37 CFR 1.78(a)(5)). If the translation and statement were not previously filed in the provisional application, applicant will be notified in the nonprovisional application that claims the benefit of the provisional application and be given a period of time within which to file the translation and statement in the provisional application. Applicants may file the translation and statement in the provisional application even if the provisional application has become abandoned. A timely reply to such notice must include the filing in the nonprovisional application of either a confirmation that the translation and statement were filed in the provisional application or withdrawal of the benefit claim. For applications filed before September 16, 2012, an amendment or Supplemental Application Data Sheet withdrawing the benefit claim may be filed. For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, a corrected application data sheet withdrawing the benefit claim may be filed. Failure to take one of the above actions will result in the abandonment of the nonprovisional application. "\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe translation must be accompanied by a statement that the translation is accurate.  This type of filing, ie translating after filing, is intended only for emergency situations to secure a filing date.  There are obvious dangers with obtaining a correct literal translation.  Also this method places a great burden on the UPSTO.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nIllustrations are not permitted in the specification, only tables, chemical and mathematical formulas.  Also, hyperlinks are not permitted.  \r\n</div>	22
104	Numbering of Claims	"The original numbering of the claims must be preserved throughout the prosecution. When claims are canceled the remaining claims must not be renumbered. When claims are added, they must be numbered by the applicant consecutively beginning with the number next following the highest numbered claim previously presented (whether entered or not). When the application is ready for allowance, the examiner, if necessary, will renumber the claims consecutively in the order in which they appear or in such order as may have been requested by applicant.

96	Application Data Sheet	For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012 any discprepancy between the the application data sheet and information submitted elsewhere, the Application data sheet will be the authority.  The only exception is for inventorship where changes can be submitted according to 37 CFR 1.48.	22
97	Abstract of the Disclosure	An abstract is required.  When not present the office of patent application processing will require it.  For the purposes of compliance the abstract is considered part of the specification.  If the application is ready to issue but the abstract does not conform with guidelines then the examiner should make any necessary revisions by a formal examiner's amendment after obtaining the applicant's authorization.\r\n<div>\r\nAn Abstract should give a reader a basic understanding of the contents of the patent.  The abstract mus commence on a separate sheet preferably following the claims.  Generally the abstract should be between 50 and 150 words in length.  It is the responsibility of the applicant to prepare the abstract.  \r\n</div>	22
105	Statutory requirement of claims	The claims are basically the definition of the protected material.	22
106	Claims present on the application filing date	"In establishing a disclosure, applicant may rely not only on the description and drawing as filed but also on the claims present on the filing date of the application if their content justifies it. "	22
107	Form of Claims	The claims must commence on a separate page directly after the detailed description of the invention.  Tradition dictates that the claimed matter must start with "I claim" or "We claim" or "The invention claimed is", depending on preference and the number of inventors. The first claims should generally be the least restrictive.  There are various indentation rules for claims.  Just look at some claims to understand these rules.	22
121	New Matter	"In establishing a disclosure, applicant may rely not only on the specification and drawing as filed but also on the claims present on the filing date of the application if their content justifies it. See MPEP § 608.01(l).\r\n\r\nWhile amendments to the specification and claims involving new matter are ordinarily entered, such matter is required to be canceled from the descriptive portion of the specification, and the claims affected are rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a).\r\n\r\nWhen new matter is introduced into the specification, the amendment should be objected to under 35 U.S.C. 132 (35 U.S.C. 251 if a reissue application) and a requirement made to cancel the new matter. The subject matter which is considered to be new matter must be clearly identified by the examiner. If the new matter has been entered into the claims or affects the scope of the claims, the claims affected should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) because the new matter is not described in the application as originally filed. "	25
130	Content Requirements for an IDS	List of all patents, publications, us applications or other information.  Also legible copies of the materials aside from US patents or US patent application publications.  Also a concise explanation of relevance for non-english language information is required.  This requirement only applies to non-English language material, but can be helpful with English language documents as well.	26
108	Dependent Claims	A dependent claim is a claim that depends on a preceding claim, either another dependent claim or an independent claim.  A multiple dependent claim is a dependent claim which refers back to more than one other claim.  \r\n<div>\r\n35 U.S.C. 112(e), authorizes multiple dependent claims in applications as long as they are in the alternative form (e.g., “A machine according to claims 3 or 4, further comprising ---”). Cumulative claiming (e.g., “A machine according to claims 3 and 4, further comprising ---”) is not permitted. A multiple dependent claim may refer in the alternative to only one set of claims. A claim such as “A device as in claims 1, 2, 3, or 4, made by a process of claims 5, 6, 7, or 8” is improper. 35 U.S.C. 112 allows reference to only a particular claim. Furthermore, a multiple dependent claim may not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim, either directly or indirectly. These limitations help to avoid undue confusion in determining how many prior claims are actually referred to in a multiple dependent claim. \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nAssume each claim example given below is from a different application.\r\n<div>\r\nA.Acceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Claim 5.

135	Excess Claim fees	For each independent claim in excess of the 3 there is a an extra fee.  There is a fee for claims exceeding 20 regardless if they are independent or dependent. "After a requirement for restriction, nonelected claims will be included in determining the fees due in connection with a subsequent amendment unless such claims are canceled. "	27
109	Treatment of Improper Dependent Claims	For the calculation of fees, persons other than the examiner must determine if a claim is dependent or not.  "The fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim."\r\n<div>\r\n"The fact that the independent and dependent claims are in different statutory classes does not, in itself, render the latter improper. Thus, if claim 1 recites a specific product, a claim for the method of making the product of claim 1 in a particular manner would be a proper dependent claim since it could not be infringed without infringing claim 1. Similarly, if claim 1 recites a method of making a product, a claim for a product made by the method of claim 1 could be a proper dependent claim. On the other hand, if claim 1 recites a method of making a specified product, a claim to the product set forth in claim 1 would not be a proper dependent claim since it is conceivable that the product claim can be infringed without infringing the base method claim if the product can be made by a method other than that recited in the base method claim. "\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nWhen examining a dependent claim, the examiner should determine whether the claim complies with 35 U.S.C. 112(d), which requires that dependent claims contain a reference to a previous claim in the same application, specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed, and include all the limitations of the previous claim. If the dependent claim does not comply with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(d), the examiner should reject the dependent claim under 35 U.S.C. 112(d) as unpatentable rather than objecting to the claim. See Pfizer, Inc. v. Ranbaxy Labs., Ltd., 457 F.3d 1284, 1291-92, 79 USPQ2d 1583, 1589-90 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding a dependent claim in a patent invalid for failure to comply with pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph (now 35 U.S.C. 112(d))). Although the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(d) are related to matters of form, non-compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112(d) renders the claim unpatentable just as non-compliance with other paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 112 would. For example, a dependent claim must be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(d) if it omits an element from the claim upon which it depends or it fails to add a limitation to the claim upon which it depends.\r\n\r\nClaims which are in improper dependent form for failing to further limit the subject matter of a previous claim, or for not including every limitation of the claim from which it depends, should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(d) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph by using form paragraphs 7.36 and 7.36.01. \r\n</div>	22
110	Infringement test for claims	"The test as to whether a claim is a proper dependent claim is that it shall include every limitation of the claim from which it depends (35 U.S.C. 112(d)) or in other words that it shall not conceivably be infringed by anything which would not also infringe the basic claim. Another requirement is that the dependent claim must specify a further limitation(s) of the subject matter claimed.\r\n\r\nA dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112(d) simply because there is a question as to the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, if claim 1 recites the combination of elements A, B, C, and D, a claim reciting the structure of claim 1 in which D was omitted or replaced by E would not be a proper dependent claim, even though it placed further limitations on the remaining elements or added still other elements.\r\n\r\nExaminers are reminded that a dependent claim is directed to a combination including everything recited in the base claim and what is recited in the dependent claim. It is this combination that must be compared with the prior art, exactly as if it were presented as one independent claim. "	22
111	Claim Form and Arrangement	"A singular dependent claim 2 could read as follows:\r\n\r\n    2. The product of claim 1 in which . . . .\r\n\r\nA series of singular dependent claims is permissible in which a dependent claim refers to a preceding claim which, in turn, refers to another preceding claim.\r\n\r\nA claim which depends from a dependent claim should not be separated therefrom by any claim which does not also depend from said “dependent claim.” It should be kept in mind that a dependent claim may refer back to any preceding independent claim. These are the only restrictions with respect to the sequence of claims and, in general, applicant’s sequence should not be changed. See MPEP § 608.01(j). Applicant may be so advised by using form paragraph 6.18. \r\nDuring prosecution, the order of claims may change and be in conflict with the requirement that dependent claims refer to a preceding claim. Accordingly, the numbering of dependent claims and the numbers of preceding claims referred to in dependent claims should be carefully checked when claims are renumbered upon allowance. "	22
116	Requirement for Drawings	Under the AIA there is no longer a requirement for drawings in a patent application unless necessary for the understanding of the subject matter.  Prior to the AIA, it was essential except for certain circumstances.  Since this is old material we will not go into detail.  December 18, 2013 was the effective date for this.\r\n<div>\r\nWhere a drawing is not necessary, but would benefit, the lack of a drawing is considered an informality.  the examiner may require a drawing to be submitted.  \r\n</div>	23
113	Basis for Claim Technology in Description	"The meaning of every term used in any of the claims should be apparent from the descriptive portion of the specification with clear disclosure as to its import; and in mechanical cases, it should be identified in the descriptive portion of the specification by reference to the drawing, designating the part or parts therein to which the term applies. A term used in the claims may be given a special meaning in the description"\r\n<div>\r\n"New claims, including claims first presented after the application filing date where no claims were submitted on filing, and amendments to the claims already in the application should be scrutinized not only for new matter but also for new terminology."\r\n</div>\r\n"The specification should be objected to if it does not provide proper antecedent basis for the claims by using form paragraph 7.44. "	22
118	Drawings standards	Drawings should be black and white and conform to the litany of standards in the MPEP 608.02.  I will let you read that, on your own time.	23
114	Completeness of Specification	The contents of the specification must satisfy the written description requirement.  It must also be enabling.  and it must identify the utility of the invention. \r\n<b>Include Information on Incorporation by Reference incl improper incorportion see MPEP 608(p)</b>	22
115	Substitute or Rewritten Specification	<b>Add content</b>	22
117	Receipt of drawing after the filing date	The receipt of drawings after the filing date should be objected to for the addition of new matter.  A new drawing without such new matter may be required by the examiner in some circumstances though.	23

120	Models and specimens	"Models or exhibits are generally not admitted as part of an application or patent unless the requirements of 37 CFR 1.91 are satisfied.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of cases involving perpetual motion, a model is not ordinarily required by the Office to demonstrate the operability of a device. If operability of a device is questioned, the applicant must establish it to the satisfaction of the examiner, but he or she may choose his or her own way of so doing. "	24
122	What constitutes new matter	"Matter not present on the filing date of the application in the specification, claims, or drawings that is added after the application filing is usually new matter."	25
123	New Matter by preliminary amendment	""A preliminary amendment present on the filing date of the application (e.g., filed along with the filing of the application) is considered a part of the original disclosure. See MPEP § 714.01(e) and § 602. A preliminary amendment filed after the filing date of the application is not part of the original disclosure of the application.	25
125	Information Disclosure Statements	Information Disclosure Statements are not permitted in provisional applications, because provisional applications are not examined.  For non-provisional applications, information disclosure statements are required as part of the duty to disclose.  Third parties cannot file information disclosure statements but they may protest using other means.	26
127	IDS Cont.	Multiple IDS with the same application my be filed and they will all be considered.	26
138	applicant, cont	37 CFR 1.43 provides that if an inventor is deceased or under legal incapacity, the legal representative of the inventor may make an application for patent on behalf of the inventor. See also MPEP § 409.01(a).\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.45 pertains to an application filed by joint inventors. Joint inventors must apply for a patent jointly and each joint inventor must make the inventor’s oath or declaration required by 37 CFR 1.63, except as provided for in 37 CFR 1.64. See 35 U.S.C. 116(a) and 37 CFR 1.45(a). If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the other joint inventor or inventors may make the application for patent on behalf of themselves and the omitted inventor. See 35 U.S.C. 116(b) and 37 CFR 1.45(a). See also MPEP § 409.02.\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.46 provides for the filing of an application for patent by an assignee, a person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter under 35 U.S.C. 118. If an application under 35 U.S.C. 111 is made by a person other than the inventor under 37 CFR 1.46(a), the application must contain an application data sheet under 37 CFR 1.76 specifying in the applicant information section the assignee, the person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, or the person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter. While identifying the party making the application for patent (the applicant) in an application data sheet is not a filing date requirement, a delay in naming the applicant under 37 CFR 1.46 may cause it to appear that applicant is the inventor and thus requiring the party to file a request under 37 CFR 1.46(c) to become the applicant, which requires compliance with 37 CFR 3.71 and 3.73. See MPEP § 325. If an assignee is filing an application under 37 CFR 1.46, but the assignee is not the assignee of the entire right, title and interest in the application, then the assignee would need to be named as the applicant under 37 CFR 1.46 together with the other party who has an ownership interest. For example, if there are two joint inventors, and one inventor has assigned his rights in the invention to the assignee, but the other inventor has not assigned his rights in the invention and is under no obligation to assign his rights, the assignee and the other inventor should be identified as the applicant in the applicant information section of the application data sheet. See 37 CFR 3.71.\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is the assignee or person to whom the inventor is under an obligation to assign the invention, the documentary evidence of ownership (e.g., assignment for an assignee, employment agreement for an obligated assignee) should be recorded as provided for in 37 CFR part 3 no later than the date the issue fee is paid. See 37 CFR 1.46(b)(1).\r\n\r\nIf the applicant is a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the matter, such applicant must submit a petition including: (1) the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(g); (2) a showing that such person has sufficient proprietary interest in the matter; and (3) a statement that making the application for patent by a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest on behalf of and as agent for the inventor is appropriate to preserve the rights of the parties. See 37 CFR 1.46(b)(2). A discussion of the evidence necessary for a showing that a person has sufficient proprietary interest in the matter is set forth in MPEP § 409.05. The Office may publish notice of the filing of the application by a person who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest in the Official Gazette. See 37 CFR 1.46(f).\r\n\r\nAny request to correct or update the name of the applicant after an applicant has been specified under 37 CFR 1.46(b) must include an application data sheet under 37 CFR 1.76 specifying the correct or updated name of the applicant in in the applicant information section. See 37 CFR 1.46(c)(1). Thus, if there is no change in the applicant itself but just the applicant’s name (due to a correction or name change), the applicant need only submit an application data sheet specifying the correct or updated name of the applicant in the applicant information section. Any corrected application data sheet must identify the information being changed with underlining for insertions and strike-through or brackets for text removed as required by 37 CFR 1.76(c)(2). A change in the name of the applicant recorded pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 16(1)(ii) will be effective to change the name of the applicant in a nonprovisional international design application.	29
139	Change of Applicant	Where no applicant is identified, the Office will, by default, consider the inventor to be the applicant (e.g., to complete processing of the application so that it can be forwarded for examination). Any request to change the applicant must include an application data sheet under 37 CFR 1.76 specifying the applicant in the applicant information section in accordance with 37 CFR 1.76(c)(2) and must comply with 37 CFR 3.71 and 3.73. See 37 CFR 1.46(c)(2). Thus, if there is a change of applicant under 37 CFR 1.46 (e.g., from the inventor to the assignee, or from one assignee to another assignee), the new applicant must establish its ownership of the application under 37 CFR 3.71(b) and 3.73.\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.46(e) provides that if a patent is granted on an application filed under 37 CFR 1.46 by a person other than the inventor, the patent shall be granted to the real party in interest (e.g., the current assignee for an application that has been assigned). Otherwise, the patent may be issued to the assignee or jointly to the inventor and the assignee as provided in 37 CFR 3.81.\r\n\r\nWhere a real party in interest has filed an application under 37 CFR 1.46, the applicant shall notify the Office of any change in the real party in interest no later than payment of the issue fee. The Office will treat the absence of such a notice as an indication that there has been no change in the real party in interest. See 35 U.S.C. 118 and 37 CFR 1.46(e). The use of box 3 of the Part B – Fee(s) Transmittal form, PTOL-85B will be required where the real party in interest has changed from filing of the application and the application was filed pursuant to 37 CFR 1.46.	29
140	Substitute Statements	In the situation where it is impossible to obtain an oath or declaration, a substitute statement may be submitted to the USPTO.	30
141	Oaths	"An oath or affirmation may be made before any person within the United States authorized by law to administer oaths. An oath made in a foreign country may be made in accordance with 37 CFR 1.66. The authority of military personnel to act as a notary is set forth in 10 U.S.C. 1044(a). "\r\nThe attorney in the case may not administer the oaths.  The Office strongly encourages the use of declarations rather than oaths.  One reason being the common practice of impressing a physical seal upon the oath which presents storage difficulties.	31
142	Declarations	"Any document to be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office and which is required by any law, rule, or other regulation to be under oath may be subscribed to by a written declaration."	31
143	Inventorship Declarations	All inventors must provide an oath or declaration except for provisional applications.  The applicant may name the inventorship of a nonprovisional application in the application data sheet or the inventor's oath or declaration, so long as the ADS is in compliance.  \r\n<div>\r\n"Unless such information is supplied in an application data sheet in accordance with 37 CFR 1.76, the oath or declaration must also identify: (1) each inventor by his or her legal name; (2) a mailing address where the inventor or each joint inventor customarily receives mail; and (3) a residence for each inventor or joint inventor who lives at a location which is different from where the inventor or joint inventor customarily receives mail. See 37 CFR 1.63(b)."\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Assignment Statement as oath or declaration</b>\r\n<div>\r\nAn assignment may also serve as a declaration if the assignment includes the information required in a declaration and a copy of the assignment is properly recorded.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n"An oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63, including the assignment-statement provided for in 37 CFR 1.63(e), must be executed (i.e., signed) in accordance either with 37 CFR 1.66, or with an acknowledgement that any willful false statement made in such declaration or statement is punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001 by fine or imprisonment of not more than five (5) years, or both."\r\n</div>	31
144	Correction of Inventorship	"Correction of inventorship in an application is permitted by amendment under 35 U.S.C. 116, which is implemented by 37 CFR 1.48"\r\n<div>\r\nAlthough 37 CFR 1.48 does not contain a diligence requirement for filing the request, once an inventorship error is discovered, timeliness requirements under 37 CFR 1.116 and 37 CFR 1.312 apply.\r\n\r\nA request under 37 CFR 1.48 will not be required:\r\n\r\n(A)Where an application is to issue with the correct inventorship based on the allowed claims even though the application may have been filed with an incorrect inventorship based on the claims as originally submitted; and\r\n\r\n(B)Where a court has issued an order under 35 U.S.C. 256 for correction of the inventorship of a patent. Such request should be submitted directly to the Certificate of Correction Division along with form PTO/SB/44 (see MPEP § 1485)\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nInventorship can also be corrected by filing a continuation application without the need for filing a specific request.  \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n"35 U.S.C. 120 permits a continuing application to claim the benefit of the filing date of a copending, previously filed, parent application provided there is inventorship overlap between the continuing application and the parent application. If the inventive entity of a continuing application includes an inventor named in the parent application, the inventorship overlap required by 35 U.S.C. 120 is met. However, refiling to change inventorship could result in the loss of a benefit claim if there is no overlap in inventorship between the two applications. " \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nNote that a correction of inventorship may result in the loss of power of attorney. For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, 37 CFR 1.32(e) provides that if the power of attorney was granted by the originally named inventive entity, and an added inventor pursuant to 37 CFR 1.48 does not provide a power of attorney consistent with the power of attorney granted by the originally named inventive entity, the addition of the inventor results in the loss of that power of attorney upon grant of the 37 CFR 1.48 request. This provision does not preclude a practitioner from acting in a representative capacity pursuant to 37 CFR 1.34, if applicable.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nFor applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the inventorship in the continuing application is the inventor or joint inventors specified in the ADS filed before or with the copy of the inventor’s oath or declaration from the earlier-filed application. If an ADS is not filed before or with the copy of the inventor’s oath or declaration, then the inventorship is the inventorship in the copy of the inventor’s oath or declaration from the earlier-filed application, unless accompanied by a statement, signed by a 37 CFR 1.33(b) party, stating the name of each inventor in the continuing application. Any new joint inventor named in the continuing application must execute an inventor’s oath or declaration, except as provided for in 37 CFR 1.64. \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nRequests for correction of inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48 filed on or after September 16, 2012 will be handled by the Office of Patent Application Processing (OPAP).\r\nI.37 CFR 1.48(a) - Nonprovisional Application\r\n\r\nUnder 37 CFR 1.48(a), an applicant may submit a request for correction of inventorship in a nonprovisional patent application once the inventorship has been established. See MPEP § 602.08(b), subsection III, for details regarding naming inventorship in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012.\r\n\r\nA request to correct the inventorship filed under 37 CFR 1.48(a) should identify the inventorship change and must be accompanied by a signed application data sheet (ADS) including the legal name, residence, and mailing address of the inventor or each actual joint inventor (see 37 CFR 1.76(b)(1)) and the processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(i). The application data sheet submitted with a request under 37 CFR 1.48(a) must identify the information being changed with underlining for insertions and strike-through or brackets for text removed.\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.48(a) enables an applicant to correct inventorship where an application sets forth improper inventorship as well as where the prosecution of an application results in the need to add or delete one or more inventors (e.g., due to the addition or deletion of claims or an amendment to the claims).\r\nII. 37 CFR 1.48(b) – Inventor’s Oath or Declaration for Added Inventor\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.48(b) provides that an oath or declaration as required by 37 CFR 1.63, or a substitute statement in compliance with 37 CFR 1.64, will be required for any actual inventor who has not yet executed such an oath or declaration.\r\n\r\nFor applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the oath or declaration required by 37 CFR 1.48(b) must comply with 37 CFR 1.63 in effect for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012. See MPEP § 602.01(a). A substitute statement in compliance with 37 CFR 1.64 is only available for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012. See MPEP § 604 for the requirements for substitute statements.\r\n\r\nFor applications filed before September 16, 2012, the oath or declaration required by 37 CFR 1.48(b) for an added inventor must comply with pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.63 which remains in effect for applications filed before September 16, 2012. See MPEP § 602.01(b).\r\nIII.37 CFR 1.48(c) – Request filed after Office Action on the Merits\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.48(c) provides that the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(d) (in addition to the processing fee) is required when requests under 37 CFR 1.48 are filed after the Office action on the merits has been given or mailed in the application. However, the fee will not be required when inventors are deleted if the request to correct or change inventorship is accompanied by a statement that the request to correct or change the inventorship is due solely to the cancelation of claims in the application.\r\nIV.37 CFR 1.48(d) – Provisional Application\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.48(d) provides for correcting inventorship in provisional applications. Under 37 CFR 1.41(c), the inventorship of a provisional application is the inventor or joint inventors set forth in the cover sheet as prescribed by 37 CFR 1.51(c)(1). Once a cover sheet is filed in a provisional application, any correction of inventorship must be pursuant to 37 CFR 1.48. If a cover sheet as prescribed by 37 CFR 1.51(c)(1) is not filed during the pendency of a provisional application, the inventorship is the inventor or joint inventors set forth in the application papers filed pursuant 37 CFR 1.53(c), unless the applicant files a paper, including the processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(q), supplying the name or names of the inventor or joint inventors.\r\n\r\n37 CFR 1.48(d) provides a procedure for adding or deleting or correcting or updating the name of an inventor in a provisional application. 37 CFR 1.48(d) requires that the submission include: (1) a request, signed by a party set forth in 37 CFR 1.33(b), to correct the inventorship that identifies each inventor by his or her legal name; and (2) the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(q). When an inventor is being added, applicants should also file a corrected application data sheet or a new cover sheet providing the residence of all inventors. See 37 CFR 1.51(c). For provisional applications, it may not be necessary to correct the inventorship under 37 CFR 1.48(d) unless there would be no overlap of inventors upon the filing of the nonprovisional application with the correct inventorship. The need to correct the inventorship in any U.S. nonprovisional or provisional application may in part be dependent upon whether a foreign filing under the Paris Convention will occur subsequent to the U.S. filing. See MPEP § 213. \r\n</div>	31
145	Oaths and Declarations Cont.	<div>\r\nFor applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, joint inventors may execute separate oaths or declarations in which only the person executing the oath or declaration is identified if an ADS is filed that provides the required inventor information. If such an ADS is not filed, then each oath or declaration must name all of the inventors. See 37 CFR 1.63(a) and (b). Each separate oath or declaration by an inventor should be complete in itself. \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nExaminers are no longer required to review inventor’s oaths or declarations that are filed in non-reissue applications. Non-examiner staff will review inventor’s oaths or declarations.\r\n</div>\r\n<b>Foreign Executed Oath</b>\r\n<div>\r\n"An oath executed in a foreign country must be properly authenticated." \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe US is part of the Hague Convention Apostille agreement\r\n"Accordingly, the Office will accept for filing or recording a document sworn to or acknowledged before a notary public in a member country if the document bears, or has appended to it, an apostille certifying the notary’s authority. The requirement for a diplomatic or consular certificate, specified in 37 CFR 1.66, will not apply to a document sworn to or acknowledged before a notary public in a member country if an apostille is used. "\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n"For applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, a continuing application, including a continuation-in-part application, may be filed with a copy of an oath or declaration or substitute statement from the prior nonprovisional application, provided that the oath or declaration is in compliance with 37 CFR 1.63 or the substitute statement is in compliance with 37 CFR 1.64."\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<b>Non-English Oath or Declaration</b>\r\n37 CFR 1.69 requires that oaths and declarations be in a language which is understood by the individual making the oath or declaration, i.e., a language which the individual comprehends.If an individual uses a language other than English for an oath or declaration, the oath or declaration must include a statement that the individual understands the content of any documents to which the oath or declaration relates.\r\n</div>	31
146	Supplemental Oath or Declaration	(a) The applicant may submit an inventor's oath or declaration meeting the requirements of § 1.63, § 1.64, or § 1.162 to correct any deficiencies or inaccuracies present in an earlier-filed inventor's oath or declaration.	31

MPEP § 1205, under the heading “Appeal By Patent Applicant,” states that “[a] notice of appeal may be filed after any of the claims has been twice rejected, regardless of whether the claim(s) has/have been finally rejected.  The limitation of ‘twice or finally...rejected’ does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an appeal in the continuing application, even if the claim was rejected only once in the continuing application.”  (A), (B), (C), and (D) are not the most correct answer because a notice of appeal can be filed in a continuing application where at least one of the rejected claims was twice rejected, and one of the rejections may occur in the parent application. 
10068	(C) The filing of a notice of appeal is not a proper reply because not all the claims in the continuing application have been twice rejected.   	816	f	8. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 1205, under the heading “Appeal By Patent Applicant,” states that “[a] notice of appeal may be filed after any of the claims has been twice rejected, regardless of whether the claim(s) has/have been finally rejected.  The limitation of ‘twice or finally...rejected’ does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an appeal in the continuing application, even if the claim was rejected only once in the continuing application.”  (A), (B), (C), and (D) are not the most correct answer because a notice of appeal can be filed in a continuing application where at least one of the rejected claims was twice rejected, and one of the rejections may occur in the parent application. 
10069	(D)A notice of appeal is never a proper response to a non-final rejection. 	816	f	8. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 1205, under the heading “Appeal By Patent Applicant,” states that “[a] notice of appeal may be filed after any of the claims has been twice rejected, regardless of whether the claim(s) has/have been finally rejected.  The limitation of ‘twice or finally...rejected’ does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an appeal in the continuing application, even if the claim was rejected only once in the continuing application.”  (A), (B), (C), and (D) are not the most correct answer because a notice of appeal can be filed in a continuing application where at least one of the rejected claims was twice rejected, and one of the rejections may occur in the parent application. 
10070	(E)The reply is proper.	816	t	8. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.

ANSWER: (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S. applications.  35 U.S.C. § 119(a).  As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119, which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed in a country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or to citizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
10074	(D)One  of  the  conditions  for  benefit  under  35  USC  119(a)  is  that  the  foreign  application  must  be  for  the  same  or  a  nonobvious  improvement  of  the  inventiondescribed in the United States application.	817	t	9. ANSWER: (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S. applications.  35 U.S.C. § 119(a).  As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119, which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed in a country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or to citizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
10313	(C) A description pursuant to 37 CFR 1.71. 	865	f	7. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111; 37 CFR § 1.53; MPEP § 601.01.  As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  Answers (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a specification as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. § 112 containing a description pursuant to § 1.71 and at least one claim pursuant to § 1.75, and any drawing required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date. 
10075	(E)If a foreign application for which priority is being claimed under 35 USC 119 is filed  in  a  country  which  does  not  afford  similar  privileges  in  the  case  ofapplications  filed  in  the  United  States  or  to  citizens  of  the  United  States  and  theforeign country is not a WTO member country, any claim for the foreign priority thereto by a U.S. application will not be effective. 	817	f	9. ANSWER: (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S. applications.  35 U.S.C. § 119(a).  As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119, which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed in a country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or to citizens of the United States or in a WTO member country.

10126	(A)The  examiner’s  rejection  of  the  claims  to  the  microorganism  under  35  USC  101as being unpatentable because microorganisms are living matter and living matter is non-statutory subject matter.	828	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131.  MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established.  In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).”  Here, the claimed microorganism and the prior art microorganism appear to be the identical.  (A) is an incorrectchoice.  MPEP § 2105, under the heading “Patentable Subject Matter – Living Subject Matter,” states “...the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability.”  The Supreme Court has held that biological materials such as microorganisms, and non-human animals, is patentable subject matter, provided it is made by man.  Here, Eric’s isolation and purification the microorganism from its natural state (environment) makes it a product of human ingenuity, as opposed to a product of nature.  Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980).  (B) is an incorrect choice.  MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “III. Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” states that the “courts have found utility for therapeutic invention despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or bioactive compound or composition.”  See, Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  See also, In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  CitingBrana, MPEP § 2107.01 states, “Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe 35 USC 101, under the logic of ‘practical’ utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans.”  See also, MPEP § 2107.03, under the heading “Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utilities, I. A ReasonableCorrelation Between the Evidence and the Asserted Utility is Sufficient,” which states “As ageneral matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility.  Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Jolles, 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 206 F.2d 881 (CCPA 1981).  An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof.  The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such utility is asserted.  Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is areasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use.”  Since mice are routinely used to test anti-cancer drugs for their tumoricidal activity, it is reasonable to assume that thecompound, spectaculysem, may be useful as a therapeutic agent.  (C) is an incorrect choice.  MPEP § 2145, under the subheading “X. Arguing Improper Rationales for CombiningReferences.  A. Impermissible Hindsight.”  If, as acknowledged by the examiner, a novel microorganism has been discovered, then any product which it makes could not have been anticipated by, or obvious over, the prior art.  The examiner’s rejection is based purely on hindsight derived from his or her reading of the applicant’s specification. 
10127	(B)  The  examiner’s  rejection  of  the  claims  to  the  compound  under  35  USC  101  as  having no credible utility because Eric has only tested the compound in mice andcuring  mice  of  cancer  has  no  “real  world”  value.    The  examiner  also  states  that  Eric must demonstrate that the compound works in humans in order to show that it has a patentable utility. 	828	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131.  MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established.

10136	(A)An  argument  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  low  melting  point  of  150° F, supported by an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2exhibits a melting point of 300° F.	830	t	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself.  The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production.  If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’  In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).”  The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y.  MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product.  In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).”  Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim.  Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different.  Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).  Therefore, the best reply to the outstandingrejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product.  (B) is not the most correct answer.  The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis ofproduct characteristics, not process steps.  (C) is not the most correct answer.  The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual.  Thus, the argument is not supported by facts.  As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in theapplication.  In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).”  Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C).  (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B).  (E) is not the most correct answer.  Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties.  But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).

10161	(A)In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration, it is sufficient to allege that applicantor patent owner has been diligent. 	835	f	27. ANSWER (B) is the most correct answer.  See Ex parte Merz, 75 USPQ 296 (Bd. App. 1947) (holding that the “lapse of time between the completion or reduction to practice of an invention and the filing of an application thereon” is not relevant to an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.131(b)); MPEP § 715.07(a).  (A) is incorrect.  Ex parte Hunter, 1889 C.D. 218, 49 O.G. 733 (Comm’r Pat. 1889); MPEP § 715.07(a).  Applicant must show evidence of facts establishing diligence.  (C) is incorrect.

App. 1958) (after conception has been clearly established, diligence must be considered prior to the effectivedate is clearly established, since diligence then comes into question); MPEP § 715.07(a).  (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 715.07(c).  37 CFR § 1.131(a) provides for the establishment of a date of completion of the invention in a NAFTA or WTO member country, as well as in the United States, an applicant can establish a date of completion in a NAFTA member country on or after December 8, 1993, the effective date of section 331 of Public Law 103 - 182, the North American Free Trade Agreement Act, and can establish a date of completion in a WTO member country other than a NAFTA member country on or after January 1, 1996, the effective date of section 531 of Public Law 103 - 465, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.  Not all countries are members of NAFTA or WTO, and prior invention in a foreign country cannot be shown without regard for when the reduction to practice occurred.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP § 715.07.  Actual reduction to practice generally, but not always, requires a showing that the apparatus actually existed and worked, “There are some devices so simple that a mere construction of them is all that is necessary to constitute reduction to practice.”  In re Asahi/America Inc., 68 F.3d 442, 37 USPQ2d 1204 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citingNewkirk v. Lulegian, 825 F.2d 1581, 3USPQ2d 1793 (Fed. Cir. 1987) and Sachs v. Wadsworth, 48 F.2d 928, 929, 9 USPQ 252, 253 (CCPA 1931).  The claimed restraint coupling held to be so simple a device that mere construction of it was sufficient to constitute reduction to practice.  Photographs, coupled with articles and a technical report describing the coupling in detail were sufficient to show reduction to practice.). 
10162	(B)  In  a  37  CFR  1.131  affidavit  or  declaration,  it  is  sufficient  to  clearly  establish  conception  of  the  invention  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  reference,  and  diligence from just prior to the effective date of the reference to actual reduction to practice.  The presence of a lapse of time between the reduction to practice of an invention and the filing of an application thereon is not relevant.	835	t	27. ANSWER (B) is the most correct answer.

This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(4) provides, in part, “(4)...Captured bibliographic information derived from an application data sheet containing errors may be recaptured by a request therefor and the submission of a supplemental application data sheet, an oath or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.63 or § 1.67, or a letter pursuant to 37 CFR 1.33(b).”  (A) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(a).  (B) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(b).  (D) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(c).  (E) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76 (d)(4). 
11160	(E)      The abstract should compare the invention with the prior art. 	1034	t	26.   ANSWER:   (E).   The  abstract  should  not  compare  the  invention  with  the  prior  art.    MPEP  §  608.01(b).    As  to  (A)  through  (C),  see  MPEP  §  608.01(b).    As  to  (D),  when  the  process  for  making is not obvious, the process should be set forth in the abstract.  See MPEP § 608.01(b). 
10190	(E)  The  Office  will  initially  capture  bibliographic  information  from  the  application  data   sheet   notwithstanding   whether   an   oath   or   declaration   governs   the   information.    Thus,  the  Office  shall  generally  not  look  to  an  oath  or  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.63  to  see  if  the  bibliographic  information  contained  therein  isconsistent  with  the  bibliographic  information  captured  from  an  application  data  sheet  (whether  the  oath  or  declaration  is  submitted  prior  to  or  subsequent  to  theapplication data sheet). 	840	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(4) provides, in part, “(4)...Captured bibliographic information derived from an application data sheet containing errors may be recaptured by a request therefor and the submission of a supplemental application data sheet, an oath or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.63 or § 1.67, or a letter pursuant to 37 CFR 1.33(b).”  (A) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(a).  (B) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(b).  (D) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76(c).  (E) is in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.76 (d)(4). 
10191	(A)The  Lancer  patent  discloses  and  claims  an  electric  toothbrush,  but  does  notmention whether its toothbrush includes a power supply.	841	t	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers.  Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....”  See MPEP § 2131, citingIn re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  In (E), the on/off switch of Lancer’s toothbrush is arranged differently than that of the claimed toothbrush.  (A) is accepted as correct because the given facts do not specify the location of the power supply as being included within the toothbrush.  Though the description of the toothbrush as being electric can imply an inherent source of power, it may also may imply an external power source for the electric toothbrush. Accordingly, (A) is also accepted as a correct answer in the circumstances.  (B) is incorrect because evidence of secondary considerations, such as commercial success, is irrelevant to a 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejection.  See MPEP § 2131.04.  (C) is incorrect.  “‘Arguments that the alleged anticipatory prior art...‘teaches away from the invention’...[are] not ‘germane’ to a rejection under section 102.’”  MPEP § 2131.05 (quotingTwin Disc, Inc. v. United States, 231 USPQ 417, 424 (Cl. Ct. 1986)).  (D) is incorrect.  “The term ‘others’ in 35 U.S.C. 102(a) refers to any entity which is different from the inventive entity.  The entity need only differ by one person to be ‘by others.’  This holds true for all types of references eligible as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a) including publications....”  MPEP § 2132.  Here, because Lancer is only one of three inventors of the claim, the patent is by others. 
10192	(B) Evidence is submitted to show the electric toothbrush claimed in the application iscommercially successful.	841	f	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers.  Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....”  See MPEP § 2131, citingIn re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  In (E), the on/off switch of Lancer’s toothbrush is arranged differently than that of the claimed toothbrush.  (A) is accepted as correct because the given facts do not specify the location of the power supply as being included within the toothbrush.  Though the description of the toothbrush as being electric can imply an inherent source of power, it may also may imply an external power source for the electric toothbrush.

(B) is incorrect because evidence of secondary considerations, such as commercial success, is irrelevant to a 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejection.  See MPEP § 2131.04.  (C) is incorrect.  “‘Arguments that the alleged anticipatory prior art...‘teaches away from the invention’...[are] not ‘germane’ to a rejection under section 102.’”  MPEP § 2131.05 (quotingTwin Disc, Inc. v. United States, 231 USPQ 417, 424 (Cl. Ct. 1986)).  (D) is incorrect.  “The term ‘others’ in 35 U.S.C. 102(a) refers to any entity which is different from the inventive entity.  The entity need only differ by one person to be ‘by others.’  This holds true for all types of references eligible as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a) including publications....”  MPEP § 2132.  Here, because Lancer is only one of three inventors of the claim, the patent is by others. 
10193	(C) The Lancer patent teaches away from the bristles of the claimed toothbrush.	841	f	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers.  Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....”  See MPEP § 2131, citingIn re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).  In (E), the on/off switch of Lancer’s toothbrush is arranged differently than that of the claimed toothbrush.  (A) is accepted as correct because the given facts do not specify the location of the power supply as being included within the toothbrush.  Though the description of the toothbrush as being electric can imply an inherent source of power, it may also may imply an external power source for the electric toothbrush. Accordingly, (A) is also accepted as a correct answer in the circumstances.  (B) is incorrect because evidence of secondary considerations, such as commercial success, is irrelevant to a 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejection.  See MPEP § 2131.04.

The entity need only differ by one person to be ‘by others.’  This holds true for all types of references eligible as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a) including publications....”  MPEP § 2132.  Here, because Lancer is only one of three inventors of the claim, the patent is by others. 
10199	(D)I, II, and III. 	842	f	34. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144.03 provides that when an applicant seasonably traverses an officially noticed fact, the examiner may cite a reference teaching the noticed fact and make the next action final.  Here, applicant did seasonably traverse the noticed fact by demanding proof in response to the rejection.  II is therefore an appropriate action by the examiner.  I is also an appropriate action because the examiner should vacate a rejection based on official notice if no support for the noticed fact can be found in response to a challenge by the applicant.  See In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091 (C.C.P.A. 1970) (“[a]ssertions of technical facts in areas of esoteric technology must always be supported by citation to some reference work” and “[a]llegations concerning specific “knowledge” of the prior art, which might be peculiar to a particular art should also be supported”).  (B) is incorrect because (A) is correct. (C), (D), and (E) are incorrect because action III is improper.  An applicant is entitled to respond to a rejection by requesting reconsideration, with or without amending the application.  37 CFR § 1.111(a)(1).  Applicant is also required to timely challenge a noticed fact in order to preserve the issue for appeal.  MPEP § 2144.03. 
10194	(D)Lancer  is  one  of  the  three  named  inventors  of  the  claimed  toothbrush  in  the  pending application.  	841	f	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers.  Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....”  See MPEP § 2131, citingIn re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

Here, because Lancer is only one of three inventors of the claim, the patent is by others. 
10195	(E) The on/off switch in the Lancer patent is on a different side of the body than that recited in the claim for the electric toothbrush in the patent application. 	841	t	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers.  Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....”  See MPEP § 2131, citingIn re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

10201	(A) Record in the USPTO an assignment of all right, title, and interest in the patent to the  public,  conditioned  on  the  receipt  by  Igor  of  all  royalties  from  licensing  the  patent after the first five years of the patent term.	843	f	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.”  35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.”  (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.  (B) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) provides for dedication to the public of “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” only.  “[T]he first five years of the patent term” does not qualify as a terminal part of the term.  (C) is wrong because Igor would not achieve his objective of dedicating at least a portion of his patent term to the public, since the term of thedesign patent would expire on January 23, 2015.  35 U.S.C. § 173.  (D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent.  “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).

See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b).  35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.”  The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
10205	(E) File a disclaimer in the USPTO dedicating to the public that portion of the term ofthe patent from January 24, 2010 to January 23, 2015. 	843	t	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.”  35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.”  (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.

(D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent.  “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a). 
10206	(A)Since Mike invented the invention, Alice cannot properly file an application for a patent in her name even though Mike is unavailable. 	844	t	36. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  (A) is true since only the inventor may file for a patent.  35 U.S.C. § 101.

10229	(D)      A      claim.   	848	t	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b).  35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.”  The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
10230	(E) A cover sheet complying with the rule.	848	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b).  35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.”  The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application.

10221	(A)Saturday, May 27, 2000	847	f	39. ANSWER: (D). MPEP § 710.02(e), under the heading “Final Rejection – Time For Reply” states, “If an applicant initially replies within 2 months from the date of mailing of any final rejection setting a 3-month shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising applicant of the status of the application...”  Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern, the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000.  37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”  (A), (B), and (C) are wrong because they recite dates which are earlier than May 31, 2000, the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time.  (E) is wrong because it is after the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time, and therefore an extension of time would be required. 
10222	(B) Monday, May 29, 2000 (a Federal holiday, Memorial Day). 	847	f	39. ANSWER: (D). MPEP § 710.02(e), under the heading “Final Rejection – Time For Reply” states, “If an applicant initially replies within 2 months from the date of mailing of any final rejection setting a 3-month shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising applicant of the status of the application...”  Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern, the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000.  37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”  (A), (B), and (C) are wrong because they recite dates which are earlier than May 31, 2000, the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time.  (E) is wrong because it is after the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time, and therefore an extension of time would be required. 
10223	(C) Tuesday, May 30, 2000.	847	f	39. ANSWER: (D). MPEP § 710.02(e), under the heading “Final Rejection – Time For Reply” states, “If an applicant initially replies within 2 months from the date of mailing of any final rejection setting a 3-month shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising applicant of the status of the application...”  Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern, the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000.  37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”  (A), (B), and (C) are wrong because they recite dates which are earlier than May 31, 2000, the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time.

10224	(D)Wednesday, May 31, 2000. 	847	t	39. ANSWER: (D). MPEP § 710.02(e), under the heading “Final Rejection – Time For Reply” states, “If an applicant initially replies within 2 months from the date of mailing of any final rejection setting a 3-month shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising applicant of the status of the application...”  Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern, the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000.  37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”  (A), (B), and (C) are wrong because they recite dates which are earlier than May 31, 2000, the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time.

10225	(E)Tuesday, August 29, 2000.	847	f	39. ANSWER: (D). MPEP § 710.02(e), under the heading “Final Rejection – Time For Reply” states, “If an applicant initially replies within 2 months from the date of mailing of any final rejection setting a 3-month shortened statutory period for reply and the Office does not mail an advisory action until after the end of the 3-month shortened statutory period, the period for reply for purposes of determining the amount of any extension fee will be the date on which the Office mails the Advisory Action advising applicant of the status of the application...”  Hence, since no extension fee was paid in the fact pattern, the time allowed applicant for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken is the mail date of the Advisory Action, i.e., May 31, 2000.  37 CFR § 1.192(a) recites, in pertinent part, “Appellant must, within two months from the date of the notice of appeal under § 1.191 or within the time allowed for reply to the action from which the appeal was taken, if such time is later, file a brief in triplicate.”  (A), (B), and (C) are wrong because they recite dates which are earlier than May 31, 2000, the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time.  (E) is wrong because it is after the last date for filing a Brief without an extension of time, and therefore an extension of time would be required. 
10226	(A)      A      specification.   	848	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b).  35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.”  The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11545	(B) The application is abandoned because the applicant did not rescind the nonpublication request before filing the application in Japan. The applicant must now file a petition and fee to revive under 37 CFR 1.137.	1112	f	see MPEP 1123 and 1123
10231	(A)The Foreman reference is nonanalogous art, but the reference may be reasonably pertinent to Barry’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which Barry was concerned.	849	f	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2143.03.  To establish prima facieobviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art.  (A) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 2141.01(a).  Although an argument that the reference is nonanalogous art may be appropriate, it is overcome by the acknowledgment that the reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned.  As discussed in MPEP § 2141.01(a), under the heading “To Rely On A Reference Under 35 U.S.C. 103, It Must Be Analogous Prior Art,” which quotes In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to rely on a reference as a basis for rejection of the  applicant’s invention, “the reference must either be in the field of the applicant’s endeavor or, if not, be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which theinventor was concerned.”  Here, the argument acknowledges that reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s problem solving endeavor.  (C) is incorrect.  U.S. patents may b used as of their filing dates to show that the claimed subject matter is anticipated or obvious.  See MPEP § 2136.02 under the heading “The Supreme Court Has Authorized 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections Based On 35 USC 102(e).”  (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 716.01(c), under the heading, “To Be Of Probative Value, Any Objective Evidence Should Be Supported By Actual Proof,” states “Objective evidence which must be factually supported by an appropriate affidavit or declaration to be of probative value includes evidence of unexpected results....”  It also quotes fromIn re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699, 222 USPQ 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1984), “It is well settled that unexpected results must be established by factual evidence.  Mere argument or conclusory statements in the specification does not suffice.”  De Blauwe, 736 F.2d at 705, 222 USPQ at 196.  Here, the conclusory statement in the specification does not suffice.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2145, subsection VIII (under the heading “Arguing About The Age Of References”), quotingfrom In re Wright, 569 F.2d 1124, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977), states “The mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.”  Here, the mere fact that the Foreman patent issued 105 years before the filing date of the pending patent application is unpersuasive of the non-obviousness of the applicant’s claim 
10232	(B) The rejection does not address a claimed limitation, and neither of the references teaches the claimed limitation.	849	t	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2143.03.  To establish prima facieobviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art.  (A) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 2141.01(a).

10233	(C) The Barry patent issued after the filing date of the pending patent application.	849	f	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2143.03.  To establish prima facieobviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art.  (A) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 2141.01(a).  Although an argument that the reference is nonanalogous art may be appropriate, it is overcome by the acknowledgment that the reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned.  As discussed in MPEP § 2141.01(a), under the heading “To Rely On A Reference Under 35 U.S.C. 103, It Must Be Analogous Prior Art,” which quotes In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to rely on a reference as a basis for rejection of the  applicant’s invention, “the reference must either be in the field of the applicant’s endeavor or, if not, be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which theinventor was concerned.”  Here, the argument acknowledges that reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s problem solving endeavor.  (C) is incorrect.  U.S. patents may b used as of their filing dates to show that the claimed subject matter is anticipated or obvious.  See MPEP § 2136.02 under the heading “The Supreme Court Has Authorized 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections Based On 35 USC 102(e).”  (D) is incorrect.

11161	(A) Determining the scope and contents of the prior art.	1035	f	27.  ANSWER:  The most correct answer is (B).  35 U.S.C. § 103; Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966); MPEP § 2141.  Resolving any issue of indefiniteness in favor of clarity is not among the factual inquiries enunciated in Graham.  The four factual inquiries are set forth in answers (A), (C), (D), and (E). 
10246	(A)Indicate  the  claim  allowable  over  the  prior  art  because  there  is  no  teaching,  motivation or suggestion to increase the amount of polypropylene from 34.9% to35% and decrease the amount of polyethylene from 65.1% to 65%. 	852	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.  See MPEP § 2144.05.  In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985), a claim recited a titanium base alloy consisting essentially of 0.8% nickel, 0.3% molybdenum, up to 0.1% maximum iron, and the balance titanium.  A prior art reference described two similar alloys: (i) one with 0.25% molybdenum, 0.75% nickel, and balance titanium; and (ii) another with 0.31% molybdenum, 0.94% nickel, and balance titanium.  The court held: As admitted by appellee’s affidavit evidence from James A. Hall, the Russian article discloses two alloys having compositions very close to that of claim 3, which is 0.3% Mo and 0.8% Ni, balance titanium.  The two alloys in the prior art have 0.25% Mo-0.75% Ni and 0.31% Mo-0.94% Ni, respectively.  The proportions are so close that prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.  Appellee produced no evidence to rebut that prima facie case.  The specific alloy of claim 3 must therefore be considered to have been obvious from known alloys.Id. Thus, (A) is incorrect.  (B) and (D) are incorrect because a claim is anticipated by a prior artreference only when the prior art discloses, either expressly or inherently, every limitation of theclaimed invention.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
10247	(B) Reject the claim under 35 USC 102 as anticipated by the prior art reference. 	852	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.  See MPEP § 2144.05.  In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed.

(B) and (D) are incorrect because a claim is anticipated by a prior artreference only when the prior art discloses, either expressly or inherently, every limitation of theclaimed invention.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
10248	(C) Reject the claim under 35 USC 103 as obvious over the prior art reference. 	852	t	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.  See MPEP § 2144.05.  In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed.

(E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
10249	(D)Reject  the  claim  alternatively  under  35  USC  102  as  anticipated  by  or  under  35  USC 103 as obvious over the prior art reference. 	852	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.  See MPEP § 2144.05.  In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed.

(E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
10262	(B)       mathematical       equations.    	855	f	47. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 608.01, under the heading “Illustrations In The Specification,” states “[t]he specification, including any claims...may not contain drawings or flow diagrams.”  With respect to answers (A) and (B), see MPEP § 608.01, under the heading “Illustrations In The Specification,” states, “[t]he specification, including any claims, may contain chemical formulas and mathematical equations...” As to answer (D), see MPEP § 608.01(m), which states that periods may not be used elsewhere in the claim except for abbreviations and that each claim begins with a capital letter and ends wit a period.  As to (E), see MPEP § 608.01, which states, “The...claims may contain tables only if necessary to conform to 35 U.S.C. 112.”
11546	(C) The applicant should file an amendment to the specification of the U.S. application, adding the recent improvements to the disclosure in the specification.	1112	f	see MPEP 1122 and 1123
10250	(E)None of the above. 	852	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.

10251	(A)File  a  reply  brief  bringing  the  new  ground  of  rejection  to  the  attention  of  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences  and  pointing  out  that  37  CFR  1.193(a)(2) prohibits entry of the new ground of rejection. 	853	f	45. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 1208.01 states: “Any allegation that an examiner’s answer contains an impermissible new ground of rejection is waived if not timely (37 CFR 1.181(f)) raised by way of a petition under 37 CFR 1.181(a).”  Thus, to avoid waiver of the right to contest the examiner’s action, the appellant must file a timely petition.  (A) is incorrect because the question of whether an answer contains a new ground of rejection is a petitionable, not appealable, matter.  See MPEP § 1201.  (C) is incorrect because an amendment or new evidence is needed to overcome the new ground of rejection and merely presenting arguments will not succeed.  (D) is incorrect because the entry of the amendment or evidence is subject to the provisions of 37 CFR §§ 1.116 and 1.195 and there is no assurance that the examiner will approve entry.  (E) is incorrect because it will constitute a waiver on the question of whether an impermissible new ground of rejection has been entered.
10252	(B) File a timely petition pursuant to 37 CFR 1.181 seeking supervisory review of theexaminer’s entry of an impermissible new ground of rejection in the answer, after efforts to persuade the examiner to reopen prosecution or remove the new groundof rejection are unsuccessful.	853	t	45. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.

(A) is incorrect because the question of whether an answer contains a new ground of rejection is a petitionable, not appealable, matter.  See MPEP § 1201.  (C) is incorrect because an amendment or new evidence is needed to overcome the new ground of rejection and merely presenting arguments will not succeed.  (D) is incorrect because the entry of the amendment or evidence is subject to the provisions of 37 CFR §§ 1.116 and 1.195 and there is no assurance that the examiner will approve entry.  (E) is incorrect because it will constitute a waiver on the question of whether an impermissible new ground of rejection has been entered.

See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading“Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.”  Paraphrasing the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients.  On the other hand, a composition claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of iron, 20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may be read in theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate.  Here, because the invention is a non-theoretical alloy, the sum of the claimed constituents cannot exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering Claim 2 ambiguous as to the percentage of element A.  (A) is incorrect.  The sum of gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium and copper components in Claim 2 is 100%.  (B) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron”includes 21% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 11% gallium, and “at least 10% copper includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper.  (E) is incorrect because Claim 1 uses the open transition phrase “comprising,” which permits additional elements to be added to the composition.  Nothing in the problem indicates that an additional component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10284	(D)If  Harriet  refiles  her  application  as  a  continued  prosecution  application  under  37  CFR 1.53(d), wherein small entity status is appropriate and desired, it will not be necessary  to  specifically  establish  assertion  of  such  status  in  the  continued  prosecution application.	859	f	1. ANSWER: (B) is correct and (A), (C) and (D) are wrong.  37 CFR § 1.27(c)(4) (“The refilingof an application under § 1.53 as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application, including a continued prosecution application under § 1.53(d), or the filing of a reissue application, requires a new assertion as to continued entitlement to small entity status for the continuing or reissue application.”).  (E) is also wrong.  37 CFR § 1.27(e)(1) (“Where an assignment of rights...to other parties who are small entities occurs subsequent to an assertion ofsmall entity status, a second assertion is not required.”)
11548	(E) The applicant could today notify the USPTO of the foreign filing. It is not necessary to file a petition and fee to revive for the application to continue to be examined in the USPTO.	1112	f	see MPEP 1122 and 1123
10277	(B) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing at least 21% by volume of iron, 11% by volume of gallium, and 10.01% by volume of copper.	858	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading“Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.”  Paraphrasing the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients.

(A) is incorrect.  The sum of gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium and copper components in Claim 2 is 100%.  (B) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron”includes 21% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 11% gallium, and “at least 10% copper includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper.  (E) is incorrect because Claim 1 uses the open transition phrase “comprising,” which permits additional elements to be added to the composition.  Nothing in the problem indicates that an additional component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10278	(C) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing 20% by volume of iron, 10% by volumeof gallium, and 10% by volume of copper. 	858	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading“Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.”  Paraphrasing the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients.

(A) is incorrect.  The sum of gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium and copper components in Claim 2 is 100%.  (B) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron”includes 21% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 11% gallium, and “at least 10% copper includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect.  “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper.  (E) is incorrect because Claim 1 uses the open transition phrase “comprising,” which permits additional elements to be added to the composition.  Nothing in the problem indicates that an additional component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10279	(D)Claim  2:  The  alloy  of  claim  1  containing  54%  by  volume  of  copper  and  27%  by  volume of gallium.	858	t	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading“Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.”  Paraphrasing the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients.

Here, because the invention is a non-theoretical alloy, the sum of the claimed constituents cannot exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering Claim 2 ambiguous as to the percentage of element A.  (A) is incorrect.  The sum of gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium and copper components in Claim 2 is 100%.

(E) is incorrect because Claim 1 uses the open transition phrase “comprising,” which permits additional elements to be added to the composition.  Nothing in the problem indicates that an additional component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10281	(A)  If  Harriet  files  a  related,  continuing  application  wherein  small  entity  status  isappropriate and desired, it will not be necessary to specifically establish assertion of such status in the continuing application. 	859	f	1. ANSWER: (B) is correct and (A), (C) and (D) are wrong.  37 CFR § 1.27(c)(4) (“The refilingof an application under § 1.53 as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application, including a continued prosecution application under § 1.53(d), or the filing of a reissue application, requires a new assertion as to continued entitlement to small entity status for the continuing or reissue application.”).  (E) is also wrong.  37 CFR § 1.27(e)(1) (“Where an assignment of rights...to other parties who are small entities occurs subsequent to an assertion ofsmall entity status, a second assertion is not required.”)
10282	(B)  If  Harriet  files  a  related,  reissue  application  wherein  small  entity  status  isappropriate  and  desired,  it  will  be  necessary  to  specifically  establish  assertion  of  such status in the reissue application. 	859	t	1.

10286	(A)Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount of D to reduce the acidity of the composition. 	860	f	2.ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading “III. Effective Amount.”  The claim presented in (B) is improper as “an effective amount” has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state the function that is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the specification.  In re Fredericksen 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954).  It is unclear whether “an effective amount” in (B) is an effective amount to reduce acidity or an effective amount to reduce moisture.  The claims presented in (A) and (C) find support in the disclosure, which provides guidelines for determining “an effective amount” for each of the claims in (A) and (C).  See MPEP § 2173.05(c) under the heading “III. Effective Amount.”  The claim presented in (D) is not indefinite, given that A, B, and C are known materials as set forth in the question and the composition can be determined by the claim language.  (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.

10310	(E)(A), (B), and (C). 	864	f	6. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 1411.01.  As to (A) see MPEP § 1402.  A reissue patent is not granted.  As to (B), new matter may not be entered in a reissue.  As to (D) see MPEP § 1412.03.  Since (A), and (B) are incorrect, (E) is incorrect.
10311	(A)An oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.51(b)(2).	865	t	7. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111; 37 CFR § 1.53; MPEP § 601.01.  As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  Answers (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a specification as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. § 112 containing a description pursuant to § 1.71 and at least one claim pursuant to § 1.75, and any drawing required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date. 
10291	(A) A U.S. patent application is filed within the one year anniversary date of the filingdate of the foreign application.  The reference is the foreign application. 	861	f	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(d); MPEP § 2135.01, under the heading “A Continuation - In - Part Breaks The Chain Of Priority As To Foreign As Well As U.S. Parents.”  If an applicant files a foreign application, later files a U.S. application claimingpriority based on the foreign application, and then files a continuation - in - part (CIP) application whose claims are not entitled to the filing date of the U.S. parent, the effective filingdate of the CIP application is the filing date of the CIP.  The applicant cannot obtain the benefit of either the U.S. parent or foreign application filing dates.  In re van Langenhoven, 173 USPQ 426, 429 (CCPA 1972); Ex parte Appeal No. 242 - 47, 196 USPQ 828 (Bd. App. 1976).  (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(d).

10292	(B)  The  applicant  files  a  foreign  application,  later  timely  files  a  U.S.  applicationclaiming  priority  based  on  the  foreign  application,  and  then  files  a  continuation-in-part  (CIP)  application,  and  the  claims  in  the  CIP  are  not  entitled  to  the  filing  date  of  the  U.S.  parent  application.    The  foreign  application  issues  as  a  patentbefore  the  filing  date  of  the  CIP  application  and  is  used  to  reject  the  claims  directed to the added subject matter under 35 USC 102(d)/103.  The reference isthe foreign application. 	861	t	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(d); MPEP § 2135.01, under the heading “A Continuation - In - Part Breaks The Chain Of Priority As To Foreign As Well As U.S. Parents.”  If an applicant files a foreign application, later files a U.S. application claimingpriority based on the foreign application, and then files a continuation - in - part (CIP) application whose claims are not entitled to the filing date of the U.S. parent, the effective filingdate of the CIP application is the filing date of the CIP.  The applicant cannot obtain the benefit of either the U.S. parent or foreign application filing dates.  In re van Langenhoven, 173 USPQ 426, 429 (CCPA 1972); Ex parte Appeal No. 242 - 47, 196 USPQ 828 (Bd. App. 1976).  (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(d).

10312	(B) A specification as prescribed by the first paragraph of 35 USC 112.	865	f	7. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 111; 37 CFR § 1.53; MPEP § 601.01.  As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR § 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  Answers (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a specification as prescribed by 35 U.S.C. § 112 containing a description pursuant to § 1.71 and at least one claim pursuant to § 1.75, and any drawing required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date. 
11163	(C) Ascertaining the differences between the prior art and the claims in issue. 	1035	f	27.  ANSWER:  The most correct answer is (B).  35 U.S.C. § 103; Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 148 USPQ 459 (1966); MPEP § 2141.  Resolving any issue of indefiniteness in favor of clarity is not among the factual inquiries enunciated in Graham.  The four factual inquiries are set forth in answers (A), (C), (D), and (E). 
10295	(E)All of the above.	861	f	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(d); MPEP § 2135.01, under the heading “A Continuation - In - Part Breaks The Chain Of Priority As To Foreign As Well As U.S. Parents.”  If an applicant files a foreign application, later files a U.S. application claimingpriority based on the foreign application, and then files a continuation - in - part (CIP) application whose claims are not entitled to the filing date of the U.S. parent, the effective filingdate of the CIP application is the filing date of the CIP.  The applicant cannot obtain the benefit of either the U.S. parent or foreign application filing dates.  In re van Langenhoven, 173 USPQ 426, 429 (CCPA 1972); Ex parte Appeal No. 242 - 47, 196 USPQ 828 (Bd. App. 1976).  (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(d).  (C) is not correct.  35 U.S.C. § 102(d); MPEP § 2135.01, under the heading “An Allowed Application Can Be A ‘Patent’ For Purposes Of 35 U.S.C. 102(d) As Of The Date Published For Opposition Even Though It Has Not Yet Been Granted As A Patent,” citingEx parte Beik, 161 USPQ 795 (Bd. App. 1968).  An application must issue into a patent before it can be applied in a 35 U.S.C. 102(d) rejection.  Ex parte Fujishiro, 199 USPQ 36 (Bd. App. 1977).  (D) is not correct.  35 U.S.C. § 102(d); MPEP § 2136, under the heading “Defensive Publications Are Not Prior Art As Of Their Filing Date,” citing Ex parte Osmond, 191 USPQ 334 (Bd. App. 1973).  (E) is not correct inasmuch as (A), (C) and (D) are not correct.
10296	(A)  If  an  appropriate  reply  is  submitted  within  the  three  month  period  of  suspension  permitted under 37 CFR 1.103(c), the application will not be held abandoned.	862	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  As stated in MPEP § 709, under the heading“Request By The Applicant,” subheading “Request for Suspension Under 37 CFR 1.103(b) or (c),” “The Office will not grant the requested suspension of action unless the followingrequirements are met: (A) the request must be filed with the filing of a CPA or an RCE...(1) if the request is filed with an RCE, the RCE must be in compliance with 37 CFR 1.114, i.e., theRCE must be accompanied by a submission and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e).  Note that the payment of the RCE filing fee may not be deferred and the request for suspension cannot substitute for the submission.”  The RCE was improper because no submission in reply to the outstanding Office action accompanied the RCE.  Since the RCE was improper, the Office will not recognize the request for suspension.  The time period set in the final rejection continues to run from the mail date of the Office action.  Since the Office action did not set a period for reply, applicant has a maximum period of six months for reply.  A reply was due on February 8, 2003.  Since the RCE was improper and the Office did not recognize the request for suspension, the application became abandoned at Midnight of February 8, 2003.  (A), (B) and (E) are not correct.  As stated in MPEP § 706.07(h), under the heading “Submission Requirement,” “If a reply to an Office action under 35 U.S.C. 132 is outstanding, the submission must meet the reply requirements of 37 CFR 1.111.  See 37 CFR 1.114(c).”  An RCE that is not accompanied by a submission is an improper RCE.  As stated in MPEP § 706.07(h), under the heading “Initial Processing,” subheading “Treatment of Improper RCE,” “An improper RCE will not operate to toll the running of any time period set in the previous Office action for reply to avoid abandonment of the application.”  The period for filing a proper reply was six months inasmuch as no shortened statutory period for reply was set.  A proper reply to the final rejection was not filed.  Therefore, the application went abandoned for failure to file a proper reply to the final rejection.  (D) is not correct.  As set forth in MPEP § 706.07(f) under the heading “Examiner’s Amendments,” paragraph (H), “[a]n examiner’s amendment may not be made more than 6 months from the date of the final Office action, as the application would be abandoned at that point by operation of law.”
10297	(B)  The  application  will  not  be  held  abandoned  if  an  appropriate  reply  is  submittedwithin the three month period of suspension and it is accompanied by a showing that  the  reply  could  not  have  been  submitted  within  the  period  set  in  the  final  rejection.  For example, the reply includes a showing based on an experiment thatrequired 8 months to conduct. 	862	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  As stated in MPEP § 709, under the heading“Request By The Applicant,” subheading “Request for Suspension Under 37 CFR 1.103(b) or (c),” “The Office will not grant the requested suspension of action unless the followingrequirements are met: (A) the request must be filed with the filing of a CPA or an RCE...(1) if the request is filed with an RCE, the RCE must be in compliance with 37 CFR 1.114, i.e., theRCE must be accompanied by a submission and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e).

10298	(C) No reply will prevent the application from being held abandoned.	862	t	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  As stated in MPEP § 709, under the heading“Request By The Applicant,” subheading “Request for Suspension Under 37 CFR 1.103(b) or (c),” “The Office will not grant the requested suspension of action unless the followingrequirements are met: (A) the request must be filed with the filing of a CPA or an RCE...(1) if the request is filed with an RCE, the RCE must be in compliance with 37 CFR 1.114, i.e., theRCE must be accompanied by a submission and the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e).

10299	(D)If,  on  January  10,  2003,  the  primary  examiner  and  applicant  agree  to  an  examiner’s amendment that places the application in condition for allowance anda  notice  of  allowance  is  mailed  within  the  three  month  period  of  suspension,application X will not be held abandoned. 	862	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.

10321	(A)Inventor C, who has not signed the oath or declaration, may revoke the power of attorney to practitioner E and appoint practitioner F to prosecute the application.	867	f	9. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states: “[t]he assignee of record of the entire interest in an application may intervene in the prosecution of the application, appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice.  See 37 CFR § 3.71.  Such intervention, however, does not exclude the applicant from access to the application to see that it is beingprosecuted properly, unless the assignee makes specific request to that effect.”  (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect.  MPEP § 409.03(i) is directly contrary to answer (A), and provides that a non-signing inventor cannot revoke or give a power of attorney without agreement of all named inventors or the 37 CFR § 1.47(b) applicant.  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 106 does not empower an inventor who has assigned his or her rights to exclude a non-signing joint inventor from accessing an application in which the latter party is named as a joint inventor.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP § 106.  Corporation D, as an assignee of a part interest, cannot exclude the non-signingjoint inventor from access to the application.  See also, MPEP § 106.01, which states “While it is only the assignee of record of the entire interest who can intervene in the prosecution of an application or interference to the exclusion of the applicant, an assignee of a part interest or a licensee of exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.”  (D) is incorrect because MPEP § 409.03(i) states that a nonsigning inventor is entitled to inspect any papers in the application, and order copies at the price set forth in 37 CFR § 1.19.

10322	(B)  Inventor  C  cannot  be  excluded  from  access  t  the  application  because  inventor  B  has  not  agreed  to  exclude  inventor  C.    In  order  to  exclude  a  co-inventor  fromaccess to an application, all the remaining inventors must agree to exclude that co-inventor. 	867	f	9. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states: “[t]he assignee of record of the entire interest in an application may intervene in the prosecution of the application, appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice.  See 37 CFR § 3.71.  Such intervention, however, does not exclude the applicant from access to the application to see that it is beingprosecuted properly, unless the assignee makes specific request to that effect.”  (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect.

10323	(C) Inasmuch as one of the named joint inventors has not assigned his or her rights to Corporation  D,  the  corporation  is  not  an  assignee  of  the  entire  right  and  interest,  and therefore cannot exclude inventor C from access to the application.	867	t	9. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states: “[t]he assignee of record of the entire interest in an application may intervene in the prosecution of the application, appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice.

10327	(B)  If  the  form  of  the  claim  (as  distinguished  from  its  substance)  is  improper,  an  objection is made. 	868	t	10. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 706.01.  (A) and (C) are incorrect.  As stated by MPEP § 706.01, “The practical difference between a rejection and an objection is that a rejection, involving the merits of the claim, is subject to review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, while an objection, if persisted, may be reviewed only by way of petition to the Commissioner.”  (D) is incorrect.

10328	(C) An objection, if maintained by an examiner, is subject to review by the Board ofPatent Appeals and Interferences.	868	f	10. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 706.01.  (A) and (C) are incorrect.  As stated by MPEP § 706.01, “The practical difference between a rejection and an objection is that a rejection, involving the merits of the claim, is subject to review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, while an objection, if persisted, may be reviewed only by way of petition to the Commissioner.”  (D) is incorrect.

10330	(E)An  example  of  a  proper  rejection  is  a  rejection  of  a  dependent  claim  for  being  dependent  on  a  claim  that  has  been  rejected  only  over  prior  art,  where  the  dependent claim is otherwise allowable.	868	f	10. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 706.01.  (A) and (C) are incorrect.

10331	(A) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the assignee. 	869	f	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In the case of a division or continuation application, a prior assignment recorded against the original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to both applications.”  MPEP § 307 states, “Irrespective of whether the assignee participates in the prosecution of the application, the patent issues to the assignee if so indicated on the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B. Unless an assignee’s name and address are identified in item 3 of the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to the applicant.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information so supplied.”  A new assignment document need not be recorded for a divisional or continuation application where the assignment recorded in the parent application remains the same.  Accordingly, answers (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address are identified in item 3 of PTOL-85B, the patent will issued to the application and the assignee information, even if recorded, will not appear on the patent.  (C) is incorrect for the same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  There is no connection between the filing receipt, PAIR or the patent application publication and the recorded assignment.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent application publication when applicant includes assignment information for purposes of publication of the application on the transmittal letter.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, answer (E) is correct and answer (C) is incorrect. 
10332	(B) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the  assignee,  and  confirm  that  USPTO’s  bibliographic  data  for  application  Bidentifies  XYZ  Company  as  the  assignee  by  checking  the  filing  receipt  for  application B, the U.S. application publication of application B, or the USPTO’sPatent  Application  Information  Retrieval  (PAIR)  system  data  for  application  B,  depending on when the practitioner filed the assignment document in application B.	869	f	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In the case of a division or continuation application, a prior assignment recorded against the original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to both applications.”  MPEP § 307 states, “Irrespective of whether the assignee participates in the prosecution of the application, the patent issues to the assignee if so indicated on the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B.

Accordingly, answers (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address are identified in item 3 of PTOL-85B, the patent will issued to the application and the assignee information, even if recorded, will not appear on the patent.  (C) is incorrect for the same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  There is no connection between the filing receipt, PAIR or the patent application publication and the recorded assignment.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent application publication when applicant includes assignment information for purposes of publication of the application on the transmittal letter.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, answer (E) is correct and answer (C) is incorrect. 
10360	(E)None of the above. 	874	f	16. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning.  See MPEP § 2111.01.  (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term.  See MPEP § 2111.01  (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper.  See MPEP§ 2111.01.  (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification.  See MPEP § 2111.01. 
10333	(C) Confirm that XYZ Company is identified as the assignee on the U.S. applicationpublication of application B. 	869	f	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 306 and 307.

Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, answer (E) is correct and answer (C) is incorrect. 
10334	(D) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the assignee, and confirm that XYZ Company is identified as the assignee on theU.S. application publication of application B. 	869	f	11.

(C) is incorrect for the same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  There is no connection between the filing receipt, PAIR or the patent application publication and the recorded assignment.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent application publication when applicant includes assignment information for purposes of publication of the application on the transmittal letter.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, answer (E) is correct and answer (C) is incorrect. 
10335	(E)Upon allowance of application B, the practitioner must identify XYZ Company as the  assignee  in  the  appropriate  space  on  the  Issue  Fee  Transmittal  form  for  specifying the assignee for application B. 	869	t	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In the case of a division or continuation application, a prior assignment recorded against the original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to both applications.”  MPEP § 307 states, “Irrespective of whether the assignee participates in the prosecution of the application, the patent issues to the assignee if so indicated on the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B. Unless an assignee’s name and address are identified in item 3 of the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to the applicant.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information so supplied.”  A new assignment document need not be recorded for a divisional or continuation application where the assignment recorded in the parent application remains the same.  Accordingly, answers (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address are identified in item 3 of PTOL-85B, the patent will issued to the application and the assignee information, even if recorded, will not appear on the patent.  (C) is incorrect for the same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  There is no connection between the filing receipt, PAIR or the patent application publication and the recorded assignment.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent application publication when applicant includes assignment information for purposes of publication of the application on the transmittal letter.  Assignment data printed on the patent will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, answer (E) is correct and answer (C) is incorrect. 
10336	(A)Interferences  will  generally  be  declared  even  when  the  applications  involved  are  owned  by  the  same  assignee  since  only  one  patent  may  issue  for  any  given  invention. 	870	f	12. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2292.  As to (A) see 37 CFR § 1.602(a).  As to (B) see 37 CFR § 1.601(m), which provides that the senior party has earliest effective filing date.

As to (A) see 37 CFR § 1.602(a).  As to (B) see 37 CFR § 1.601(m), which provides that the senior party has earliest effective filing date.  As to (C), see MPEP § 2285 regarding merger of reissues and reexamination proceedings.  As to (E), (D) is true. 
10338	(C)  Reexamination  proceedings  may  not  be  merged  with  reissue  applications  sincethird parties are not permitted in reissue applications.	870	f	12. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2292.  As to (A) see 37 CFR § 1.602(a).  As to (B) see 37 CFR § 1.601(m), which provides that the senior party has earliest effective filing date.  As to (C), see MPEP § 2285 regarding merger of reissues and reexamination proceedings.  As to (E), (D) is true. 
10339	(D)After a reexamination proceeding is terminated and the certificate has issued, any member  of  the  public  may  obtain  a  copy  of  the  certificate  by  ordering  a  copy  of  the patent.	870	t	12. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2292.  As to (A) see 37 CFR § 1.602(a).  As to (B) see 37 CFR § 1.601(m), which provides that the senior party has earliest effective filing date.

10341	(A)File a continuing application under 37 CFR 1.53(b) with the large entity filing fee and then file a letter of express abandonment under 37 CFR 1.138 in the originalapplication after the continuing application has been accorded a filing date. 	871	f	13. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 509.03, under the heading “Correcting Errors In Small Entity Status,” states “37 CFR 1.28(c) provides that if small entity status is established in good faith and the small entity fees are paid in good faith, and it is later discovered that such status as a small entity was established in error or through error the Office was notnotified of a change of status, the error will be excused upon compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(1) and (c)(2), and the deficiency payment requirement of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(2).”  (A), (B), (C), and (E) are not correct.  Small entity status was not appropriate when the assertion of small entity status was filed with the application on November 1, 2002 and none of the actions recited in (A), (B), (C), and (E) would correct the error in claiming small entity status.  The only mechanism for correcting a good faith error in claiming small entity status is by filing a request in compliance with 37 CFR § 1.28(c). 
10358	(C)  Elemental  copper  and  copper  alloys,  based  on  the  special  definition  in  the  specification. 	874	t	16. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning.  See MPEP § 2111.01.  (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term.  See MPEP § 2111.01  (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper.  See MPEP§ 2111.01.  (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification.  See MPEP § 2111.01. 
10342	(B)  Promptly  file  a  notification  of  loss  of  small  entity  status  under  37  CFR  1.27(g)  and, thereafter, pay large entity fees whenever any subsequent fees are required.	871	f	13. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 509.03, under the heading “Correcting Errors In Small Entity Status,” states “37 CFR 1.28(c) provides that if small entity status is established in good faith and the small entity fees are paid in good faith, and it is later discovered that such status as a small entity was established in error or through error the Office was notnotified of a change of status, the error will be excused upon compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(1) and (c)(2), and the deficiency payment requirement of 37 CFR 1.28(c)(2).”  (A), (B), (C), and (E) are not correct.

10378	(C) Jane has Larry, a registered practitioner in the Washington D.C. area, who is more familiar  with  interview  practice  to  call  the  examiner.  Jane  gives  Larry  a  copy  ofthe  first  Office  action,  which  suggests  that  the  primary  examiner’s  analysis  isincorrect,  and  offers  to  explain  why.    Jane  instructs  Larry  that  because  Larry  isunfamiliar with the inventor, Larry should not agree to possible ways in which theclaims  could  be  modified,  or  at  least  indicate  to  the  examiner  that  Jane  would  have to approve of any such agreement.	878	f	20. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 713.01.

10391	(A)The Appeal Brief is filed on July 10, 2003, without a request for extension of timeunder 37 CFR 1.136. 	881	f	23. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 1206, specifically the Examiner Note for Form Paragraph 12.69.01 (“This form paragraph should be used only when no supporting reasons are presented in the brief.”).  If the examiner disagrees with the reasons given, the reason for disagreement should be addressed in the Examiner’s Answer.  As discussed at MPEP § 1208, in the Examiner Note 2 for Form Paragraph 12.55.01 “If the brief includes a statement that a grouping of claims does not stand or fall together but does not provide reasons, as set forth in 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7), [the examiner is to] notify appellant of the non-compliance using form paragraphs 12.69, 12.69.01 and 12.78.”  As discussed at MPEP § 1208, in the Examiner Note for Form Paragraph 12.55.02, if the examiner disagrees with appellant’s statement in the brief that certain claims do not stand or fall together, the examiner explains in the examiner’s answer why the claim grouping listed in the brief is not agreed with and why, if appropriate, e.g., the claims as listed by the appellant are not separately patentable.  Answer (A) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 1206, Form paragraph 12.17.  The Appeal Brief was filed less than seven months after the Notice of Appeal was filed.  The applicant should be notified of the deficiency and provided an opportunity to request a five-month extension of time.  Answer (B) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 1206, Form paragraph 12.12.  Answer (D) is incorrect.  Where the applicant omits the statement required by 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7) yet presents arguments in the argument section of the brief, the applicant should be notified of the noncompliance and given time to correct the deficiency.  See 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7); and MPEP § 1206, under the heading“Appeal Brief Content,” subheading “7. Grouping of Claims,” wherein it states, “Where, however, the appellant (A) omits the statement required by 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7) yet presents arguments in the argument section of the brief...the appellant should be notified of the noncompliance as per 37 CFR 1.192(d).  Ex parte Schier, 21 USPQ2d 1016 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991); Ex parte Ohsumi, 21 USPQ2d 1020 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991).”  See also MPEP § 1206, under the heading “Review of Brief By Examiner,” wherein it states that “if a brief is filed which does not comply with all the requirements of [37 CFR § 1.192](c), the appellant will be notified of the reasons for noncompliance.  Appellant will be given the longest of any of the following time periods to correct the defect(s): (A) 1 month or 30 days from the mailing of thenotification of non-compliance, whichever is longer; (B) within the time period for reply to the action from which appeal has been taken; or (C) within 2 months from the date of the notice of appeal under 37 CFR 1.191.”  Answer (E) is incorrect.  MPEP § 1206, under the heading“Appeal Brief Content,” states “Where an appeal brief fails to address any ground of rejection, appellant shall be notified by the examiner that he or she must correct the defect by filing a brief (in triplicate) in compliance with 37 CFR 1.192(c).”

ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  35 U.S.C. § 113 reads “Drawings submitted after the filing date of the application may not be used (i) to overcome any insufficiency of the specification due to lack of an enabling disclosure.”  Since choice (A) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.111, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (C) may be done, 35 U.S.C. § 120, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (D) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.121, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (E) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.111, it also is an incorrect answer to the above question. 
11051	(A)as a ground of appeal.	1013	f	5.     ANSWER:  (C)  is  most  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181;  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    (A)  and  (B)  are  wrong.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181(a)(1);  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    Prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  is  not  appealable.    37  C.F.R.  §    1.191(a).    (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(c)  states, “Any  question  as  to    prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  should  be  raised,  if  at  all,  while  the  application  is  still  pending  before  the  primary  examiner.”    MPEP  §  1210  indicates  that  jurisdiction is before the Board at the times set forth in (D) and (E).

10393	(C) The Appeal Brief states that the claims do not stand or fall together, and presents argument as to why the claims are separately patentable, but the primary examiner does not agree with the applicant’s argument. 	881	t	23. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 1206, specifically the Examiner Note for Form Paragraph 12.69.01 (“This form paragraph should be used only when no supporting reasons are presented in the brief.”).

MPEP § 1206, under the heading“Appeal Brief Content,” states “Where an appeal brief fails to address any ground of rejection, appellant shall be notified by the examiner that he or she must correct the defect by filing a brief (in triplicate) in compliance with 37 CFR 1.192(c).” 
10395	(E)The  Appeal  Brief  does  not  address  one  of  the  grounds  of  rejection  stated  by  the  primary examiner.	881	f	23. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 1206, specifically the Examiner Note for Form Paragraph 12.69.01 (“This form paragraph should be used only when no supporting reasons are presented in the brief.”).  If the examiner disagrees with the reasons given, the reason for disagreement should be addressed in the Examiner’s Answer.  As discussed at MPEP § 1208, in the Examiner Note 2 for Form Paragraph 12.55.01 “If the brief includes a statement that a grouping of claims does not stand or fall together but does not provide reasons, as set forth in 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7), [the examiner is to] notify appellant of the non-compliance using form paragraphs 12.69, 12.69.01 and 12.78.”  As discussed at MPEP § 1208, in the Examiner Note for Form Paragraph 12.55.02, if the examiner disagrees with appellant’s statement in the brief that certain claims do not stand or fall together, the examiner explains in the examiner’s answer why the claim grouping listed in the brief is not agreed with and why, if appropriate, e.g., the claims as listed by the appellant are not separately patentable.  Answer (A) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 1206, Form paragraph 12.17.  The Appeal Brief was filed less than seven months after the Notice of Appeal was filed.  The applicant should be notified of the deficiency and provided an opportunity to request a five-month extension of time.  Answer (B) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 1206, Form paragraph 12.12.  Answer (D) is incorrect.  Where the applicant omits the statement required by 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7) yet presents arguments in the argument section of the brief, the applicant should be notified of the noncompliance and given time to correct the deficiency.  See 37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7); and MPEP § 1206, under the heading“Appeal Brief Content,” subheading “7. Grouping of Claims,” wherein it states, “Where, however, the appellant (A) omits the statement required by 37 CFR 1.192(c)(7) yet presents arguments in the argument section of the brief...the appellant should be notified of the noncompliance as per 37 CFR 1.192(d).  Ex parte Schier, 21 USPQ2d 1016 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991); Ex parte Ohsumi, 21 USPQ2d 1020 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1991).”  See also MPEP § 1206, under the heading “Review of Brief By Examiner,” wherein it states that “if a brief is filed which does not comply with all the requirements of [37 CFR § 1.192](c), the appellant will be notified of the reasons for noncompliance.  Appellant will be given the longest of any of the following time periods to correct the defect(s): (A) 1 month or 30 days from the mailing of thenotification of non-compliance, whichever is longer; (B) within the time period for reply to the action from which appeal has been taken; or (C) within 2 months from the date of the notice of appeal under 37 CFR 1.191.”  Answer (E) is incorrect.  MPEP § 1206, under the heading“Appeal Brief Content,” states “Where an appeal brief fails to address any ground of rejection, appellant shall be notified by the examiner that he or she must correct the defect by filing a brief (in triplicate) in compliance with 37 CFR 1.192(c).” 
10403	(C) file a continuation-in-part application that has an enabling specification. 	883	f	25. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer.  35 U.S.C. § 113 reads “Drawings submitted after the filing date of the application may not be used (i) to overcome any insufficiency of the specification due to lack of an enabling disclosure.”  Since choice (A) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.111, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (C) may be done, 35 U.S.C. § 120, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (D) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.121, it is an incorrect answer to the above question.  Since choice (E) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.111, it also is an incorrect answer to the above question. 
11166	(A)Claim 3. An apparatus as in any one of the preceding claims, in which the tube is plastic. 	1036	f	28.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  the  correct  answer.    Claim  3  in  answer  (C)  employs  improper  multiple  dependent claim wording.  MPEP § 608.01(n)(I)(B).  (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect as each uses acceptable multiple dependent claim wording.  MPEP § 608.01(n)(I)(A). 
10396	(A)Prior   to   Wednesday,   February   14,   2001,   filing   a   request   for   continued   examination  of  the  application,  the  information  disclosure  statement,  and  the  fee  for a request for continued examination, but not paying the issue fee. 	882	t	24. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR 1.114, MPEP § 609, paragraph III. B(1)(b), under the heading “RCE and CPA,” and MPEP 706.07(h), under the heading “II. Submission Requirement.”  In (A), the information disclosure statement, is a submission under 37 CFR § 1.114(c), and the RCE was filed before the payment of the issue fee.  37 CFR § 1.114(a)(1).  (B) is incorrect because the request for continued examination was filed after payment of the issue fee, and is filed without a petition under 37 CFR § 1.313 being granted.  Therefore (B) does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(1).  (C) is incorrect because the application becomes abandoned on February 14, 2001 for failure to pay the issue fee.  Therefore the request for continued examination does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(2).  (D) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.313 will not be effective to withdraw the application from issue unless it is actually received and granted by the appropriate officials before the date of issue. 37 CFR § 1.313(d).  Thus, the request for continued examination in (D) does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(1).  (E) is incorrect because (A) is correct. 
10397	(B)  Timely  paying  the  issue  fee,  and  thereafter  filing  a  request  for  continued  examination of the application together with the information disclosure statement, and the fee for a request for continued examination, but not submitting a petitionunder 37 CFR 1.313. 	882	f	24.

(B) is incorrect because the request for continued examination was filed after payment of the issue fee, and is filed without a petition under 37 CFR § 1.313 being granted.  Therefore (B) does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(1).  (C) is incorrect because the application becomes abandoned on February 14, 2001 for failure to pay the issue fee.  Therefore the request for continued examination does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(2).  (D) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.313 will not be effective to withdraw the application from issue unless it is actually received and granted by the appropriate officials before the date of issue. 37 CFR § 1.313(d).  Thus, the request for continued examination in (D) does not satisfy the provision of 37 CFR § 1.114(a)(1).  (E) is incorrect because (A) is correct. 
10398	(C)  After  Tuesday,  February  13,  2001,  filing  a  request  for  continued  examination  of  the application together with the information disclosure statement, and the fee for a request for continued examination, but not paying the issue fee. 	882	f	24.

Since choice (E) may be done, 37 CFR § 1.111, it also is an incorrect answer to the above question. 
10406	(A)The  examiner  should  maintain  the  rejection  of  the  claims  under  35  USC  102(a)and make the rejection final.	884	t	26. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by any satisfactory evidence of the fact.  FACTS, not conclusions, must be alleged.  Evidence in the form of exhibits may accompany the affidavit or declaration. ... The affidavit or declaration must state FACTS and produce such documentary evidence and exhibits in support thereof as are available to show conception and completion of invention in this country or in a NAFTA or WTO member country (MPEP § 715.07(c)) at least the conception being at a date prior to the effective date of the reference. ... In general, proof of actual reduction to practice requires a showing that the apparatus actually existed and worked for its intended purpose.”  Here, the co-inventors admit, and the documentary exhibits relied upon demonstrate that they failed to reduce the claimed invention to practice prior to the publication date of the Bell and Watson reference.  It is also apparent that due to the lack of an antenna in the cell phone described in Smith’s and Jones’s declarations and journal article, that the cell phone which was reduced to practice prior to the publication date of the Bell and Watson article would not have worked for its intended purpose.  Accordingly, the examiner should maintain therejection and make it final.  (B) and (C) are incorrect choices since the evidence of record shows that Smith and Jones are unable to overcome the prior art.  (D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10407	(B) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and look for references which have a publication date prior to May 15, 2001. 	884	f	26. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by any satisfactory evidence of the fact.

(E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10408	(C) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and notify Smith and Jones that theirapplication is in condition for allowance. 	884	f	26. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by any satisfactory evidence of the fact.

(E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10409	(D)The examiner should maintain the rejection, but indicate that the claims would beallowable if Smith and Jones provided an original copy of the figure published intheir journal article as factual support for their declarations. 	884	f	26. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by any satisfactory evidence of the fact.

10432	(B)In those appeals in which an oral hearing has been confirmed and either the Board of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences  or  the  primary  examiner  has  indicated  adesire for the examiner to participate in the oral argument, oral argument may be presented by the examiner whether or not the appellant appears. 	889	t	31. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1209, under the heading “Participation by Examiner.”  As to (A), see MPEP § 705.  As to (C) signature requirement does not apply.  37 C.F.R. § 1.196(b); MPEP § 1205.  The notice will not be returned.  As to (D), see Gentry Gallery v. Berkline Corp., 134 F.3d 1473, 45 U.S.P.Q.2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998). 
10410	(E)The examiner should maintain the rejection and inform Smith and Jones that the declarations  are  insufficient  because  they  cannot  “swear  behind”  a  reference  which is a statutory bar. 	884	f	26. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715.07, under the heading “Facts and Documentary Evidence” states that “The essential thing to be shown under 37 CFR 1.131 is priority of invention and this may be done by any satisfactory evidence of the fact.

(B) and (C) are incorrect choices since the evidence of record shows that Smith and Jones are unable to overcome the prior art.  (D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10411	(A)      Yes.   	885	f	27. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2112, under the heading “SomethingWhich Is Old Does Not Become Patentable Upon The Discovery Of A New Property,” states that “claiming of a new use, new function or unknown property which is inherently present in the prior art does not necessarily make the claim patentable.  In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).”  The issue is whether the argument has persuasively rebutted the examiner’s prima facie case of anticipation.  The argument does not rebut the prima facie case.  The claim is directed to a string consisting only of material Z.  Patent A teaches each every element of that string; i.e., the string shape, material Z, and the string only consists of material Z.  There is nothing different between the string of the claim and that of patent A.  Under those circumstances, examiner correctly stipulated that the stretchability of the claimed string; i.e., the ability to stretch the string beyond its initial unstretched length, would be an inherent property of the disclosed string.  Whether or not patent A teaches the stretchability of its string is not defeating.  Even if Mr. Bock had discovered a new property for the string, it would still not render the claim patentable.  In re Best, supra .  Here all the product elements are the same and examiner made out a proper prima facie case of anticipation.  The burden now shifts to the practitioner to show that the patent string is not the same.  The reply, which seeks to establish adifference in properties without showing a concomitant difference in product material and shape is not persuasive as to error in the rejection.  All the other answers are wrong.  (A) is not the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2112.  (B) is not the most correct answer.  The anticipation rejection was correctly established and was not rebutted by the argument.  (C) is not the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2112, discussing when a reference can anticipate based on an inherent, as opposed to an expressly or implicit, disclosure.  (D) is not the most correct answer.  In discussing the stretchability property, the recited ability to stretch the string beyond its initial unstretched length was equally addressed.
10412	(B) Yes, but the claim should now be rejected again, this time under 35 USC 103 as obvious over Patent A.	885	f	27. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2112, under the heading “SomethingWhich Is Old Does Not Become Patentable Upon The Discovery Of A New Property,” states that “claiming of a new use, new function or unknown property which is inherently present in the prior art does not necessarily make the claim patentable.  In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).”  The issue is whether the argument has persuasively rebutted the examiner’s prima facie case of anticipation.

In re Best, supra .  Here all the product elements are the same and examiner made out a proper prima facie case of anticipation.  The burden now shifts to the practitioner to show that the patent string is not the same.  The reply, which seeks to establish adifference in properties without showing a concomitant difference in product material and shape is not persuasive as to error in the rejection.  All the other answers are wrong.  (A) is not the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2112.  (B) is not the most correct answer.  The anticipation rejection was correctly established and was not rebutted by the argument.  (C) is not the most correct answer.  See MPEP § 2112, discussing when a reference can anticipate based on an inherent, as opposed to an expressly or implicit, disclosure.  (D) is not the most correct answer.  In discussing the stretchability property, the recited ability to stretch the string beyond its initial unstretched length was equally addressed.
10413	(C) Yes, because the stretchability property is expressly taught by Patent A. 	885	f	27. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2112, under the heading “SomethingWhich Is Old Does Not Become Patentable Upon The Discovery Of A New Property,” states that “claiming of a new use, new function or unknown property which is inherently present in the prior art does not necessarily make the claim patentable.  In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).”  The issue is whether the argument has persuasively rebutted the examiner’s prima facie case of anticipation.  The argument does not rebut the prima facie case.  The claim is directed to a string consisting only of material Z.  Patent A teaches each every element of that string; i.e., the string shape, material Z, and the string only consists of material Z.

MPEP § 2121, under the heading “What Constitutes An ‘Enabling Disclosure’ Does Not Depend On The Type Of Prior Art TheDisclosure Is Contained In,” states, in reliance upon In re Moreton, 288 F.2d 708, 711, 129 USPQ 227, 230 (CCPA 1961): “The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an ‘enabling disclosure’ is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue.... There is no basis in the statute (35 U.S.C. 102 or 103) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art references on the basis of nationality.”  Answer (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2121, under the heading “Prior Art Is Presumed To Be Operable/Enabling,” states that “[w]hen the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable.”  Answer (C) is incorrect.

10436	(A)Advise Bloc that he should give up because a cure for cancer is indeed incredible and is unproven. 	890	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the best answer.  MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02.  MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956); In re Gazave, 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); and Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980) as taking the position that “[i]nventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions in any other field oftechnology.”  MPEP § 2107.02, under the heading “The Claimed Invention Is The Focus Of The Utility Requirement,” states “...regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the claimed invention to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 101 and 35 U.S.C. 112; additional statements of utility, even if not “credible,” do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility.  See, e.g.,...In re Gottlieb, 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) (‘Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes ‘indicated’ in the specification as possibly useful.’).”  The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101.  According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical manufacture of synthetic Z.  We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer.  The examiner focuses on the disclosure that synthetic Z is a cure for cancer.  Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z’s ability to cure cancer amounts to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility is alternatively demonstrated.  Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural form of Z, alleviates pain.  The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility and serves to give compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curingsubstance.  An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible.  An applicant need only show that one of the disclosed utilities is in fact credible.  In re Gottlieb, supra.  The establishment of a credible, substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous, and therefore ultimately irrelevant.  Accordingly, Mr. Bloc’s best course of action is to make the argument that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure of curing cancer.  (A) is not the most correct answer.  The advice could prevent him from getting a patent to which he may be entitled.  (B) is not the most correct answer.  A cure for cancer is ostensibly incredible.  It is hardly a response to the examiner’s rejection to ask for the chance to prove one can cure cancer.  (D) is not the most correct answer.  While it is true that the utility requirement is addressed to the claimed invention, which here is compound Y not synthetic Z, it is not enough to respond by repeating what the invention is but, rather, to show that the invention has indeed a substantial, credible, and specific utility.  Whatever is claimed as the invention, it must comply with the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101.  Here the examiner states that the claim does not comply, as evidenced by the incredible utility of the final product.  It is Mr. Bloc’s responsibility to then show that compound Y does comply with 35 U.S.C. § 101.  (E) is not the most correct answer.  Noting that synthetic Z is modeled on natural Z does not go far enough in establishing a substantial, credible and specific utility for compound Y.  It is synthetic Z’s therapeutic ability to alleviate pain which establishes the necessary alternative utility.
10437	(B)File a reply arguing that a cure for cancer is not incredible and he can prove it if given the chance. 	890	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the best answer.  MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02.  MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956); In re Gazave, 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); and Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980) as taking the position that “[i]nventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions in any other field oftechnology.”  MPEP § 2107.02, under the heading “The Claimed Invention Is The Focus Of The Utility Requirement,” states “...regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the claimed invention to satisfy 35 U.S.C. 101 and 35 U.S.C. 112; additional statements of utility, even if not “credible,” do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility.  See, e.g.,...In re Gottlieb, 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) (‘Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes ‘indicated’ in the specification as possibly useful.’).”  The issue is whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101.  According to the set of facts, we know that compound Y is an intermediate in the chemical manufacture of synthetic Z.  We are given two utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing cancer.  The examiner focuses on the disclosure that synthetic Z is a cure for cancer.  Even if one were to agree that synthetic Z’s ability to cure cancer amounts to an incredible utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101 where another substantial, credible and specific utility is alternatively demonstrated.  Here, the specification discloses that synthetic Z, like the natural form of Z, alleviates pain.  The alleviation of pain is another substantial, credible and specific utility and serves to give compound Y an alternative utility to that of being used to make a cancer-curingsubstance.  An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible.  An applicant need only show that one of the disclosed utilities is in fact credible.  In re Gottlieb, supra.  The establishment of a credible, substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible utility superfluous, and therefore ultimately irrelevant.  Accordingly, Mr. Bloc’s best course of action is to make the argument that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific utility, notwithstanding the disclosure of curing cancer.  (A) is not the most correct answer.  The advice could prevent him from getting a patent to which he may be entitled.  (B) is not the most correct answer.  A cure for cancer is ostensibly incredible.  It is hardly a response to the examiner’s rejection to ask for the chance to prove one can cure cancer.  (D) is not the most correct answer.  While it is true that the utility requirement is addressed to the claimed invention, which here is compound Y not synthetic Z, it is not enough to respond by repeating what the invention is but, rather, to show that the invention has indeed a substantial, credible, and specific utility.  Whatever is claimed as the invention, it must comply with the utility requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 101.  Here the examiner states that the claim does not comply, as evidenced by the incredible utility of the final product.  It is Mr. Bloc’s responsibility to then show that compound Y does comply with 35 U.S.C. § 101.  (E) is not the most correct answer.  Noting that synthetic Z is modeled on natural Z does not go far enough in establishing a substantial, credible and specific utility for compound Y.  It is synthetic Z’s therapeutic ability to alleviate pain which establishes the necessary alternative utility.
10438	(C)  File  a  reply  arguing  that  whether  or  not  a  cure  for  cancer  is  incredible  is  superfluous  since  Bloc  has  disclosed  another  utility  –  alleviating  pain,  which  is  not incredible.	890	t	32.

10425	(E)All of the above are correct. 	887	f	29. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2121, under the heading “What Constitutes An ‘Enabling Disclosure’ Does Not Depend On The Type Of Prior Art TheDisclosure Is Contained In,” states, in reliance upon In re Moreton, 288 F.2d 708, 711, 129 USPQ 227, 230 (CCPA 1961): “The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an ‘enabling disclosure’ is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue.... There is no basis in the statute (35 U.S.C. 102 or 103) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art references on the basis of nationality.”  Answer (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2121, under the heading “Prior Art Is Presumed To Be Operable/Enabling,” states that “[w]hen the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable.”  Answer (C) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2121.01, under the heading “35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections And Use Of Inoperative Prior Art,” quotes Symbol Technologies Inc. v. Opticon Inc., 935 F.2d 1569, 1578, 19 USPQ2d 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991) as stating that “a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103.”  Answer (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2121.01 states that “[a] reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’ if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of invention.”  Answer (E) is incorrect because answers (B), (C) and (D) are incorrect. 
10426	(A)Joan may obtain status information for Application B that is a continuation of an Application A since Application A has been published under 35 USC 122(b).	888	f	30. ANSWER: Statement (E) is false, and is thus the most correct answer.  Since a redacted copy of the application was used for publication purposes, 37 CFR § 1.14 (c)(2) provides that “(2) If a redacted copy of the application was used for the patent application publication, the copy of the specification, drawings, and papers may be limited to a redacted copy.”  For (A) and (B), see 37 CFR § 1.14(b)(2).  For (C) see 37 CFR §§ 1.14(b)(2) and (c)(1)(i).  As to (D), a coinventor is entitled to access to the application independent of whether or not he or she signed the declaration.  Note that as stated in 37 CFR § 1.41(a)(2), if a declaration or oath is not filed, the inventorship is that inventorship set forth in the application papers. 
10427	(B) Joan may be provided status information for Application D that includes the filing date if the eight-digit numerical identifier is not available and the last six digits of the numerical identifier are available.	888	f	30. ANSWER: Statement (E) is false, and is thus the most correct answer.  Since a redacted copy of the application was used for publication purposes, 37 CFR § 1.14 (c)(2) provides that “(2) If a redacted copy of the application was used for the patent application publication, the copy of the specification, drawings, and papers may be limited to a redacted copy.”  For (A) and (B), see 37 CFR § 1.14(b)(2).  For (C) see 37 CFR §§ 1.14(b)(2) and (c)(1)(i).  As to (D), a coinventor is entitled to access to the application independent of whether or not he or she signed the declaration.  Note that as stated in 37 CFR § 1.41(a)(2), if a declaration or oath is not filed, the inventorship is that inventorship set forth in the application papers. 
10428	(C) Joan may obtain status information for Application D since a U.S. patent includes a   specific   reference   under   35   USC   120   to   Application   D,   an   abandonedapplication.    Joan  may  obtain  a  copy  of  that  application-as-filed  by  submitting  a  written request including the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.19(b)(1). 	888	f	30. ANSWER: Statement (E) is false, and is thus the most correct answer.  Since a redacted copy of the application was used for publication purposes, 37 CFR § 1.14 (c)(2) provides that “(2) If a redacted copy of the application was used for the patent application publication, the copy of the specification, drawings, and papers may be limited to a redacted copy.”  For (A) and (B), see 37 CFR § 1.14(b)(2).

10429	(D)Joan  may  obtain  status  information  as  to  Application  C  since  a  coinventor  in  apending application may gain access to the application if his or her name appearsas  an  inventor  in  the  application,  even  if  she  did  not  sign  the  §  1.63  oath  ordeclaration.	888	f	30. ANSWER: Statement (E) is false, and is thus the most correct answer.  Since a redacted copy of the application was used for publication purposes, 37 CFR § 1.14 (c)(2) provides that “(2) If a redacted copy of the application was used for the patent application publication, the copy of the specification, drawings, and papers may be limited to a redacted copy.”  For (A) and (B), see 37 CFR § 1.14(b)(2).

Note that as stated in 37 CFR § 1.41(a)(2), if a declaration or oath is not filed, the inventorship is that inventorship set forth in the application papers. 
10430	(E)  Joan  may  obtain  access  to  the  entire  Application  A  by  submitting  a  written  request, since, notwithstanding the fact that only a redacted copy of Application Ahas been published, a member of the public is entitled to see the entire application upon written request. 	888	t	30. ANSWER: Statement (E) is false, and is thus the most correct answer.  Since a redacted copy of the application was used for publication purposes, 37 CFR § 1.14 (c)(2) provides that “(2) If a redacted copy of the application was used for the patent application publication, the copy of the specification, drawings, and papers may be limited to a redacted copy.”  For (A) and (B), see 37 CFR § 1.14(b)(2).

10431	(A)When  the  subject  matter  of  an  appeal  is  particularly  difficult  to  understand,  a  patentability  report  is  prepared  by  an  examiner  in  order  to  present  the  technical  background of the case to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.	889	f	31. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1209, under the heading “Participation by Examiner.”  As to (A), see MPEP § 705.  As to (C) signature requirement does not apply.  37 C.F.R. § 1.196(b); MPEP § 1205.  The notice will not be returned.  As to (D), see Gentry Gallery v. Berkline Corp., 134 F.3d 1473, 45 U.S.P.Q.2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 1998). 
10439	(D)File a reply arguing that the claim is directed to compound Y, not synthetic Z. 	890	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the best answer.  MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02.  MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956); In re Gazave, 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); and Nelson v.

10445	(E)  Yes,  the  member  of  the  public  can  order  a  copy  from  the  Office  of  PublicRecords, with a written request and payment of the appropriate fee. 	891	t	33. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written request and payment of the fee.”  (A) and (B) are not correct.  37 CFR § 1.14(c)(2).

As stated in MPEP § 103, under the heading“Published U.S. Patent Applications,” if the published patent application is pending, the application file itself will not be available to the public for inspection.” 
10446	(A)Hold  the  application  abandoned  after  expiration  of  the  three  month  shortened  statutory period for reply because an amendment adding new matter to the claimsis not a bona fide response.	892	f	34. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.  See MPEP §§ 706.03(o) and 2143.03.  MPEP § 2143.03, under the heading “Limitations Which Do Not Find Support In The Original Specification Must Be Considered,” states: “When evaluating claims for obviousness under 35 U.S.C. § 103, all the limitations of the claims must be considered and given weight, including limitations which do not find support in the specification as originally filed (i.e., new matter).”  In (C), the examiner considered the new matter as required.  MPEP § 706.03(o) states, “In amended cases, subject matter not disclosed in the original application is sometimes added and aclaim directed thereto.  Such a claim is rejected on the ground that it recites elements without support in the original disclosure under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, Waldemar Link, GmbH & Co. v. Osteonics Corp. 32 F.3d 556, 559, 31 USPQ2d 1855, 1857 (Fed. Cir. 1994); In re Rasmussen, 650 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981).”  (A) is incorrect.  An amendment adding new matter is not necessarily a non-bona fide response as (A) implies.  Moreover, abandonment is not proper after the expiration of the period for response since even if the response is considered non-responsive, applicant would be notified and given the remaining time period plus available extensions of time to reply.  See MPEP § 714.03.  (B) is incorrect.  The mere fact that a claim recites new matter does not mean that the claim lacks utility.  See MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Relationship Between 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph, And 35 U.S.C. 101,” discussing the difference between new matter under 35 U.S.C. § 112(1) and lack of utility under 34 U.S.C. § 101.

10486	(A)A composition made by the process of subjecting paprika to processing steps X, Y and Z, wherein the composition is effective for treating cancer.	900	f	42. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP § 2131.  Citing Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987), MPEP § 2131, under the heading, “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim” states, “A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found, either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art reference.”.  The claim is directed to a method of use that is not disclosed by the reference.  Answer (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01.  The claimed composition is the same as that disclosed in the prior art, because it is made from the samestarting material subjected to the same processing steps.  The recitation of “the composition is effective for treating cancer,” is only a statement of the inherent properties of the composition.  Where the claimed and prior art products are identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical processes, a prima facie case of anticipation has been established.  In re Best, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).  The burden is shifted to applicant to show that the prior art product does not necessarily possess the characteristics of the claimed product.  The reference is prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), and therefore the claim is anticipated.  Answer (B) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01, and 2112.02.  The claimed composition is the same as that disclosed in the prior art, because it is made from the samestarting material subjected to the same processing steps.  The recitation of a composition “for treating cancer” reflects only a preamble statement of an intended use of the claimed composition, which does not limit the scope of the claim.  Answer (C) is incorrect.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01.  The claimed method is the same as that disclosed in the prior art, because it subjects the same starting material to the same manipulative steps.  Therecitation of making “a cancer-treating composition” reflects only a preamble’s statement of an intended use of the claimed composition, which does not further limit the claimed method.  Answer (E) is incorrect, because (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.

10488	(C)   A   method   of   making   a   cancer-treating   composition,   comprising   subjecting   paprika to processing steps X, Y and Z. 	900	f	42. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP § 2131.  Citing Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987), MPEP § 2131, under the heading, “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim” states, “A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found, either expressly or inherently described, in a single prior art reference.”.  The claim is directed to a method of use that is not disclosed by the reference.  Answer (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01.  The claimed composition is the same as that disclosed in the prior art, because it is made from the samestarting material subjected to the same processing steps.  The recitation of “the composition is effective for treating cancer,” is only a statement of the inherent properties of the composition.  Where the claimed and prior art products are identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical processes, a prima facie case of anticipation has been established.  In re Best, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).  The burden is shifted to applicant to show that the prior art product does not necessarily possess the characteristics of the claimed product.  The reference is prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), and therefore the claim is anticipated.  Answer (B) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01, and 2112.02.  The claimed composition is the same as that disclosed in the prior art, because it is made from the samestarting material subjected to the same processing steps.  The recitation of a composition “for treating cancer” reflects only a preamble statement of an intended use of the claimed composition, which does not limit the scope of the claim.  Answer (C) is incorrect.  See 35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 2112, 2112.01.

10511	(A)The rejection is improper because 35 USC 135(b) relates to interferences. 	905	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer, and (A) and (C) are wrong.  MPEP § 715.05 states “[i]f the patent is claiming the same invention as the application and its issue date is one year or more prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application, a rejection of the claims of the application under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) should be made.  See In re McGrew, 120 F.3d 1236, 1238, 43 USPQ2d 1632, 1635 (Fed.Cir. 1997) (holding that application of 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) is not limited to interpartes interference proceedings, but may be used as a basis for ex parte rejections.)”.  (D) is wrong.  See MPEP § 2307 (“The fact that the application claim may be broad enough to cover the patent claim is not sufficient.  In re Frey, 182 F.2d 184, 86 USPQ 99 (CCPA 1950)”).  (E) is also wrong.  See MPEP § 2307 (“If the claim presented or identified as corresponding to the proposed count was added to the application by an amendment filed more than one year after issuance of the patent...then under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 135(b), an interference will not be declared unless at least one of the claims which were in theapplication...prior to expiration of the one-year period was for ‘substantially the same subject matter’ as at least one of the claims of the patent.”).
10512	(B)  The  rejection  is  proper  because  35  USC  135(b)  is  not  limited  tointer  partesproceedings, but may be used as a basis for ex parte rejections.	905	t	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer, and (A) and (C) are wrong.

11203	(C)    If  subject  matter  appearing  in  the  original  claim  is  not  found  in  the  drawing  ordetailed description, the claim should be rejected for noncompliance with the first paragraph of 35 USC 112.  	1043	t	35.  ANSWER:  (C).   According to MPEP § 608.01(l), “[t]he claim should not be attacked either by objection or rejection because this subject matter is lacking in the drawing and description.”  As to (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(l).
10513	(C)  Since  John’s  claims  would  interfere  with  Jane’s  unexpired  patent,  the  properprocedure  is  for  the  examiner  to  declare  an  interference  rather  than  to  reject  John’s claims.	905	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer, and (A) and (C) are wrong.  MPEP § 715.05 states “[i]f the patent is claiming the same invention as the application and its issue date is one year or more prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application, a rejection of the claims of the application under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) should be made.  See In re McGrew, 120 F.3d 1236, 1238, 43 USPQ2d 1632, 1635 (Fed.Cir. 1997) (holding that application of 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) is not limited to interpartes interference proceedings, but may be used as a basis for ex parte rejections.)”.  (D) is wrong.  See MPEP § 2307 (“The fact that the application claim may be broad enough to cover the patent claim is not sufficient.  In re Frey, 182 F.2d 184, 86 USPQ 99 (CCPA 1950)”).  (E) is also wrong.  See MPEP § 2307 (“If the claim presented or identified as corresponding to the proposed count was added to the application by an amendment filed more than one year after issuance of the patent...then under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 135(b), an interference will not be declared unless at least one of the claims which were in theapplication...prior to expiration of the one-year period was for ‘substantially the same subject matter’ as at least one of the claims of the patent.”).
10514	(D)The rejection is proper merely by reason of the fact that John’s claims are broad enough to cover the patent claims. 	905	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer, and (A) and (C) are wrong.  MPEP § 715.05 states “[i]f the patent is claiming the same invention as the application and its issue date is one year or more prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application, a rejection of the claims of the application under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) should be made.

(D) is wrong.  See MPEP § 2307 (“The fact that the application claim may be broad enough to cover the patent claim is not sufficient.  In re Frey, 182 F.2d 184, 86 USPQ 99 (CCPA 1950)”).  (E) is also wrong.

10515	(E)The  rejection  is  improper  inasmuch  as  John  is  claiming  “substantially  the  samesubject matter” as is claimed in the patent. 	905	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer, and (A) and (C) are wrong.  MPEP § 715.05 states “[i]f the patent is claiming the same invention as the application and its issue date is one year or more prior to the presentation of claims to that invention in the application, a rejection of the claims of the application under 35 U.S.C. § 135(b) should be made.

10516	(A) Canceled matter in the application file of a U.S. patent is a prior art reference as of the filing date under 35 USC 102(e).	906	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).  As explained in MPEP § 901.01, the “matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date in that it then constitutes prior public knowledge under 35 U.S.C. 102(a), In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).  See also MPEP 2127 and 2136.02.”  (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(e).  As stated in MPEP § 901.01, “Canceled matter in the application file of a U.S. patent is not a proper reference as of the filing date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e), see Ex parte Stalego, 154 USPQ 52, 53 (Bd. App. 1966).”  (B) is incorrect.  As stated in MPEP § 901.02, “In re Heritage, 182 F.2d 639, 86 USPQ 160 (CCPA 1950), holds that where a patent refers to and relies on the disclosure of a copending abandoned application, such disclosure is available as a reference.  See also In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).”  (C) is incorrect. As MPEP § 901.02 indicates, where the reference patent claims the benefit of a copending but abandoned application which discloses subject matter in common with the patent, and the abandoned application has an enabling disclosure of the common subject matter and claimed matter in the reference patent, the effective date of the reference as to thecommon subject matter is the filing date of the abandoned application.  In re Switzer, 77 USPQ 1, 612 O.G. 11 (CCPA 1948); Ex parte Peterson, 63 USPQ 99 (Bd. App. 1944); and Ex parte Clifford, 49 USPQ 152 (Bd. App. 1940).”  (E) is incorrect.  As stated in MPEP § 901.05, “In general, a foreign patent, the contents of its application, or segments of its content should not be cited as a reference until its date of patenting or publication can be confirmed by an examiner’s review of a copy of the document.”
10517	(B)Where a patent refers to and relies on the disclosure of a copending subsequently abandoned application, such disclosure is not available as a reference. 	906	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).  As explained in MPEP § 901.01, the “matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date in that it then constitutes prior public knowledge under 35 U.S.C. 102(a), In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).

As stated in MPEP § 901.05, “In general, a foreign patent, the contents of its application, or segments of its content should not be cited as a reference until its date of patenting or publication can be confirmed by an examiner’s review of a copy of the document.”
11578	(E)The reply is proper.	1118	t	(E) is the most correct answer.  see MPEP 1204, under the heading <b>II. Appeal by Patent Applicant</b>.
10518	(C)  Where  the  reference  patent  claims  the  benefit  of  an  earlier  filed,  copending  butsubsequently  abandoned  application  which  discloses  subject  matter  in  common  with the patent, and the abandoned application has an enabling disclosure for thecommon  subject  matter  and  the  claimed  matter  in  the  reference  patent,  theeffective date of the reference patent as to the common subject matter is the filing date of the reference patent.  	906	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).  As explained in MPEP § 901.01, the “matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date in that it then constitutes prior public knowledge under 35 U.S.C. 102(a), In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).

10519	(D) Matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date.	906	t	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).  As explained in MPEP § 901.01, the “matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date in that it then constitutes prior public knowledge under 35 U.S.C. 102(a), In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).

As stated in MPEP § 901.05, “In general, a foreign patent, the contents of its application, or segments of its content should not be cited as a reference until its date of patenting or publication can be confirmed by an examiner’s review of a copy of the document.”
10520	(E) All foreign patents are available as prior art as of the date they are translated into English. 	906	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 102(a).  As explained in MPEP § 901.01, the “matter canceled from the application file wrapper of a U.S. patent may be used as prior art as of the patent date in that it then constitutes prior public knowledge under 35 U.S.C. 102(a), In re Lund, 376 F.2d 982, 153 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1967).  See also MPEP 2127 and 2136.02.”  (A) is incorrect.  35 U.S.C. § 102(e).

As stated in MPEP § 901.05, “In general, a foreign patent, the contents of its application, or segments of its content should not be cited as a reference until its date of patenting or publication can be confirmed by an examiner’s review of a copy of the document.”
10521	(A)  A  claim  is  to  be  given  its  broadest  reasonable  interpretation  in  light  of  the  supporting disclosure in the specification.	907	f	49. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer.  MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.”  Answer (A) is incorrect because, as pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quotingIn re Okuzawa, 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)), states: “It is well settled that ‘claims are not to be read in a vacuum and limitations therein are to beinterpreted in light of the specification in giving them their “broadest reasonableinterpretation.”’”  Answer (C) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states that “[w]hen not defined by applicant in the specification, the words of a claim must be given their plain meaning.”  Answer (D) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01 states that it is only when the specification provides a definition for terms appearing in the claims can thespecification be used to interpret the claim language.  Answer (E) is incorrect.  See MPEP§ 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states, in reliance upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of 35 U.S.C. 112, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means or step plus function language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”
10578	(C) The claim interpretation that would be given by one possessing the ordinary level\nof skill in the pertinent art at the time the invention was made.	918	f	10. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As set forth in MPEP § 2173.02, “[d]efiniteness of claim language must be analyzed, not in a vacuum, but in light of: (A) The content of the particular application disclosure; (B) The teachings of the prior art; and (C) The claim interpretation that would be given by one possessing the ordinary level of skill in the pertinent art at the time the invention was made.” Answers (A), (B) and (C) each identify criteria to be analyzed in considering whether claim language is definite, therefore answer (E) which includes each of these answers is the most correct answer. Answer (D) is incorrect since it does not include criteria (C).
10522	(B)  Because  a  claim  is  read  in  light  of  the  specification,  the  claim  may  properly  be  narrowed  by  interpreting  it  as  including  elements  or  steps  disclosed  in  thespecification but not recited in the claim.	907	t	49. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer.  MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.”  Answer (A) is incorrect because, as pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quotingIn re Okuzawa, 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)), states: “It is well settled that ‘claims are not to be read in a vacuum and limitations therein are to beinterpreted in light of the specification in giving them their “broadest reasonableinterpretation.”’”  Answer (C) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states that “[w]hen not defined by applicant in the specification, the words of a claim must be given their plain meaning.”  Answer (D) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01 states that it is only when the specification provides a definition for terms appearing in the claims can thespecification be used to interpret the claim language.  Answer (E) is incorrect.  See MPEP§ 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states, in reliance upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of 35 U.S.C. 112, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means or step plus function language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”
10523	(C) If an applicant does not define a claim term in the specification, that term is givenits ordinary meaning in the art.	907	f	49. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer.  MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.”  Answer (A) is incorrect because, as pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed.

Answer (E) is incorrect.  See MPEP§ 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states, in reliance upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of 35 U.S.C. 112, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means or step plus function language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”
10524	(D)  When  an  explicit  definition  of  a  claim  term  is  provided  in  an  applicant’s  specification, that definition controls the interpretation of the term as it is used in the claims.	907	f	49. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer.  MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.”  Answer (A) is incorrect because, as pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed.

Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of 35 U.S.C. 112, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means or step plus function language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”
10525	(E)Means  plus  function  language  in  claims  which  defines  the  characteristics  of  a  machine  or  manufacture  includes  only  the  corresponding  structures  or  materialsdisclosed in the specification and equivalents thereof. 	907	f	49. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer.  MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.”  Answer (A) is incorrect because, as pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quotingIn re Okuzawa, 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)), states: “It is well settled that ‘claims are not to be read in a vacuum and limitations therein are to beinterpreted in light of the specification in giving them their “broadest reasonableinterpretation.”’”  Answer (C) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states that “[w]hen not defined by applicant in the specification, the words of a claim must be given their plain meaning.”  Answer (D) is incorrect because MPEP § 2111.01 states that it is only when the specification provides a definition for terms appearing in the claims can thespecification be used to interpret the claim language.  Answer (E) is incorrect.  See MPEP§ 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In The Art,” states, in reliance upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of 35 U.S.C. 112, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means or step plus function language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”
10526	(A)The added claims are rejected for lack of written description under 35 USC 112,first paragraph. 	908	f	50. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  Both (A) and (C) are correct.  MPEP § 2163.01, under the heading “Support For The Claimed Subject Matter In The Disclosure,” states that “[I]f the examiner concludes that the claimed subject matter is not supported [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing date of a previously filed application.”  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2163.01 states that unsupported claims “should not be rejected or objected to on the ground of new matter.  As framed by the court in In re Rasmussen, 650 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981), the concept of new matter is properly employed as a basis for objection to amendments to the abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because(B) is incorrect. 
11204	(D)If  the  subject  matter  found  in  the  claim  is  lacking  in  the  drawing  or  detaileddescription, it is the drawing and description that are defective, not the claim. 	1043	f	35.  ANSWER:  (C).   According to MPEP § 608.01(l), “[t]he claim should not be attacked either by objection or rejection because this subject matter is lacking in the drawing and description.”  As to (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(l).
10527	(B) The added claims are rejected as new matter under 35 USC 132.	908	f	50. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  Both (A) and (C) are correct.  MPEP § 2163.01, under the heading “Support For The Claimed Subject Matter In The Disclosure,” states that “[I]f the examiner concludes that the claimed subject matter is not supported [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing date of a previously filed application.”  (B) is incorrect.

10528	(C) The added claims are denied benefit of the filing date of the 2000 application.	908	f	50. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer.  Both (A) and (C) are correct.  MPEP § 2163.01, under the heading “Support For The Claimed Subject Matter In The Disclosure,” states that “[I]f the examiner concludes that the claimed subject matter is not supported [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing date of a previously filed application.”  (B) is incorrect.

10531	(A) An objection and requirement to delete new matter from the specification is\nsubject to supervisory review by petition under 37 CFR 1.181.	909	f	1.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2163.06,  under  the  heading  “Review Of New Matter Objections And Rejections,” states “A rejection of claims is reviewable by  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences,  whereas  an  objection  and  requirement  to  delete  new  matter  is  subject  to  supervisory  review  by  petition  under  37  CFR  1.181.  If  both  the  claims and specification contain new matter either directly or indirectly, and there has been both a  rejection  and  objection  by  the  examiner,  the  issue  becomes  appealable  and  should  not  be  decided  by  petition.”  Answer  (C)  is  not  accord  with  the  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP.    (A),  (B)  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    They  are  in  accord  with  proper  USPTO  procedure.    See  MPEP  §  2163.06,  under  the  heading  “Review  Of  New  Matter  Objections  And  Rejections.”  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct.  MPEP § 2163.06.
10532	(B) A rejection of claims for lack of support by the specification (new matter) is\nreviewable by appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences.	909	f	1.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2163.06,  under  the  heading  “Review Of New Matter Objections And Rejections,” states “A rejection of claims is reviewable by  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences,  whereas  an  objection  and  requirement  to  delete  new  matter  is  subject  to  supervisory  review  by  petition  under  37  CFR  1.181.

10536	(A) The examiner asserted that because the subject matter of the application and of\nKim and Lance were so easily understandable, a factual determination of the level\nof skill in the art was unnecessary.	910	t	2. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS. 
10537	(B) The Kim reference is nonanalogous art because, although it relates to the field of\nthe applicant’s endeavor, it is not pertinent to the particular problem with which\nthe applicant was concerned.	910	t	2. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS. 
10538	(C) The reason given by the examiner to combine Kim and Lance is to obtain a\nbenefit different from that offered by the applicant’s invention.	910	t	2. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS. 
10539	(D) Neither the Kim nor Lance references teaches or suggests the ambiguous claimed\nlimitation that the examiner separately rejected as indefinite.	910	t	2. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS. 
10540	(E) All of the above.	910	t	2. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS. 
10541	(A) Prior to the first Office action being mailed the inventor calls the examiner to\nwhom the application is docketed to offer help in understanding the specification.	911	f	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 713.01, under the heading “Scheduling And Conducting An Interview,” states “[a]n interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.” (A) is incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2); MPEP § 713.02. Section 713.02 states that although “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications[,] [a] request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.03. Larry is only sounding out the examiner and has no authority to commit Joe to any agreement reached with the examiner. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.09. Jane has no right to an interview following the final rejection. Although such an interview may be granted if the examiner is convinced that disposal or clarification for appeal may be accomplished with only nominal further consideration, interviews merely to restate arguments of record or to discuss new limitations which would require more than nominal reconsideration or new search should be denied. (E) is incorrect because (D) is incorrect.
10542	(B) After receiving the first Office action Jane calls the examiner for an interview for\nthe purpose of clarifying the structure and operation of the invention as claimed\nand disclosed, because the examiner’s analysis regarding patentability in the\nrejection is novel and suggests that the examiner is interpreting the claimed\ninvention in a manner very different from the inventor’s intent.	911	t	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 713.01, under the heading “Scheduling And Conducting An Interview,” states “[a]n interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.” (A) is incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2); MPEP § 713.02. Section 713.02 states that although “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications[,] [a] request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.03. Larry is only sounding out the examiner and has no authority to commit Joe to any agreement reached with the examiner. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.09. Jane has no right to an interview following the final rejection. Although such an interview may be granted if the examiner is convinced that disposal or clarification for appeal may be accomplished with only nominal further consideration, interviews merely to restate arguments of record or to discuss new limitations which would require more than nominal reconsideration or new search should be denied. (E) is incorrect because (D) is incorrect.
10556	(A) The registered practitioner should file a request and fee for an extension of time of\ntwo months.	914	f	6. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.137; and MPEP § 2268. The patent owner will need to file a petition for entry of late papers in order to have their response entered, considered and acted upon. According to MPEP 2268, “[p]ursuant to 37 CFR 1.550(d), an ex parte reexamination proceeding is terminated if the patent owner fails to file a timely and appropriate response to any Office . . . An ex parte reexamination proceeding terminated under 37 CFR 1.550(d) can be revived if the delay in response by the patent . . . was unavoidable in accordance with 37 CFR 1.137(a), or unintentional in accordance with 37 CFR 1.137(b).” (A) is not the most correct answer. In a reexamination proceeding, requests for extensions of time must be filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.550(c). See MPEP § 2265. (C) is incorrect. (C) is inconsistent with MPEP § 2266, which states that if the patent owner fails to file a timely response to any Office action, the reexamination proceeding will be terminated, and after the proceeding is terminated, the Commissioner will proceed to issue a reexamination certificate. There is no provision for issuing a notice of allowance in a reexamination proceeding. Further, (C) is incorrect inasmuch as the examiner should not mail a Notice of Allowance and grant a new patent. (D) is not the most correct answer. In a reexamination proceeding where patent owner fails to file a timely and appropriate response to any Office action, the reexamination proceeding will be terminated via issuance of the Notice of Intent to Issue Reexamination Certificate. See MPEP § 2266. (E) is not the most correct answer. In a reexamination proceeding, requests for extensions of time must be filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.550(c). 
10543	(C) Jane has Larry, a registered practitioner in the Washington D.C. area, who is more\nfamiliar with interview practice to call the examiner. Jane gives Larry a copy of\nthe first Office action, which suggests that the primary examiner’s analysis is\nincorrect, and offers to explain why. Jane instructs Larry that because Larry is\nunfamiliar with the inventor, Larry should not agree to possible ways in which the\nclaims could be modified, or at least indicate to the examiner that Jane would\nhave to approve of any such agreement.	911	f	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 713.01, under the heading “Scheduling And Conducting An Interview,” states “[a]n interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.” (A) is incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2); MPEP § 713.02.

MPEP § 713.03. Larry is only sounding out the examiner and has no authority to commit Joe to any agreement reached with the examiner. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.09. Jane has no right to an interview following the final rejection. Although such an interview may be granted if the examiner is convinced that disposal or clarification for appeal may be accomplished with only nominal further consideration, interviews merely to restate arguments of record or to discuss new limitations which would require more than nominal reconsideration or new search should be denied. (E) is incorrect because (D) is incorrect.
10544	(D) Jane calls the primary examiner after receiving the final rejection, demanding that\nthe examiner withdraw the finality of the final action. When the examiner states\nthat the final rejection is proper, Jane demands an interview as a matter of right to\nexplain the arguments.	911	f	3. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 713.01, under the heading “Scheduling And Conducting An Interview,” states “[a]n interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.” (A) is incorrect. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2); MPEP § 713.02.

(E) is incorrect because (D) is incorrect.
10546	(A) Elemental copper only, based on the plain meaning of “copper.”	912	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning. See MPEP § 2111.01. (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term. Id. (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper. See MPEP § 2111.01. (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification. See MPEP § 2111.01.
10547	(B) Copper alloys only, based on the special definition in the specification.	912	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning. See MPEP § 2111.01. (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term. Id. (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper. See MPEP § 2111.01. (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification. See MPEP § 2111.01.
10548	(C) Elemental copper and copper alloys, based on the special definition in the\nspecification.	912	t	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning. See MPEP § 2111.01. (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term. Id. (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper. See MPEP § 2111.01. (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification. See MPEP § 2111.01.
10549	(D) Any material that contains copper, including copper compounds.	912	f	4. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. When the specification expressly provides a special definition for a term used in the claims, the term must be given that special meaning. See MPEP § 2111.01. (A) is incorrect because a term is given its plain meaning only when the specification does not provide a definition for the term. Id. (B) is incorrect because the specification defines the term as being inclusive of elemental copper. See MPEP § 2111.01. (D) is incorrect because it does not take into account the definition of copper found in the specification. See MPEP § 2111.01.
10551	(A) A U.S. patent in the applicant’s field of endeavor which was issued two years\nbefore the filing date of applicant’s patent application.	913	f	5.

10561	(A) Advise Bloc that he should give up because a cure for cancer is indeed incredible\nand is unproven.	915	f	7. ANSWER: (C) is the best answer. MPEP §§ 2107.01 and 2107.02. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” cites In re Chilowsky, 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956); In re Gazave, 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); and Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980) as taking the position that “[i]nventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions in any other field of technology.”  MPEP § 2107.02, under the heading “The Claimed Invention Is The Focus Of The Utility  Requirement,”  states  “.  .  .  regardless  of  the  category  of  invention  that  is  claimed  (e.g.,  product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the claimed  invention  to  satisfy  35  U.S.C.  101  and  35  U.S.C.  112;  additional  statements  of  utility,  even if not "credible," do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility.  See, e.g., . . . In re Gottlieb,  328  F.2d  1016,  1019,  140  USPQ  665,  668  (CCPA  1964)  (‘Having  found  that  the  antibiotic  is  useful  for  some  purpose,  it  becomes  unnecessary  to  decide  whether  it  is  in  fact  useful  for  the  other  purposes  'indicated'  in  the  specification  as  possibly  useful.’).”    The  issue  is  whether Mr. Bloc has disclosed a specific utility for the claimed compound Y sufficient to satisfy the practical utility requirement of 35 U.S.C § 101.  According to the set of facts, we know that compound  Y  is  an  intermediate  in  the  chemical  manufacture  of  synthetic  Z.    We  are  given  two  utilities for synthetic Z: 1) alleviating pain, a utility it shares with the natural form of Z; and, 2) curing  cancer.    The  examiner  focuses  on  the  disclosure  that  synthetic  Z  is  a  cure  for  cancer.    Even  if  one  were  to  agree  that  synthetic  Z’s  ability  to  cure  cancer  amounts  to  an  incredible  utility, a claim to the intermediate compound Y would not run afoul of the utility requirement of 35   U.S.C.   §   101   where   another   substantial,   credible   and   specific   utility   is   alternatively   demonstrated.    Here,  the  specification  discloses  that  synthetic  Z,  like  the  natural  form  of  Z,  alleviates  pain.    The  alleviation  of  pain  is  another  substantial,  credible  and  specific  utility  and  serves  to  give  compound  Y  an  alternative  utility  to  that  of  being  used  to  make  a  cancer-curing  substance. An applicant need not show that all disclosed utilities are credible. An applicant need only  show  that  one  of  the  disclosed  utilities  is  in  fact  credible.  In  re  Gottlieb, supra.  The  establishment of a credible, substantial and specific utility renders the disclosure of an additional incredible  utility  superfluous,  and  therefore  ultimately  irrelevant.  Accordingly,  Mr.  Bloc’s  best  course of action is to make the argument that he has disclosed another substantial, credible, and specific  utility,  notwithstanding  the  disclosure  of  curing  cancer.

11552	(D)A statement by Dave that the requirement for information is improper because information used to draft a patent application may not be required unless the examiner identifies the existence of a relevant database known by Sam that could be searched for a particular aspect of the invention.	1113	f	see MPEP 704.12
10571	(A) The examiner can reject claims 1-20 in the second application using the article\nbecause the publication date of the article is earlier than the filing date of the\nsecond application.	917	f	9.  ANSWER:   The  most  correct  answer  is  (E).    See  MPEP  §  201.11,  under  the  heading  “VI.  When  Not  Entitled  To  Benefit  Earlier  Of  Filing  Date,  ”  states  “[a]ny  claim  in  a  continuation-in-part  application  which  is  directed  solely  to  subject  matter  adequately  disclosed  under  35  U.S.C.  112  in  the  parent  nonprovisional  application  is  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  filing date of the parent nonprovisional application.  However, if a claim in a continuation-in-part application  recites  a  feature  which  was  not  disclosed  or  adequately  supported  by  a  proper  disclosure  under  35  U.S.C.  112  in  the  parent  nonprovisional  application,  but  which  was  first  introduced or adequately supported in the continuation-in-part application such a claim is entitled only  to  the  filing  date  of  the  continuation-in-part  application.    See  In  re  Chu,  66.  F.3d  292,  36  USPQ2d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and Transco Products, Inc. v. Performance Contracting Inc., 38 F.3d  551,  32  USPQ2d  1077  (Fed.  Cir.  1994).”    Accordingly,  claims  1-10  are  entitled  to  the  benefit of the filing date of the first application, but claims 11-20 are not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the first application because claims 11-20 recite an improved capacitor, which was not disclosed in the first application.  Claims 1-10 have an effective filing date earlier than the publication date of the article.  Claims 11-20 have a filing date later than the publication date of the article.  For 35 U.S.C. 102(a) to apply, the reference must have a publication date earlier in time  than  the  effective  filing  date  of  the  application.    See  MPEP  706.02(a),  paragraph  “III.  35  U.S.C. 102(a).”  Thus, answers (A)-(D) are incorrect. 
10572	(B) The examiner cannot reject any of the claims in the second application using the\narticle because the second application claims the benefit of the filing date of the\nfirst application.	917	f	9.  ANSWER:   The  most  correct  answer  is  (E).    See  MPEP  §  201.11,  under  the  heading  “VI.  When  Not  Entitled  To  Benefit  Earlier  Of  Filing  Date,  ”  states  “[a]ny  claim  in  a  continuation-in-part  application  which  is  directed  solely  to  subject  matter  adequately  disclosed  under  35  U.S.C.  112  in  the  parent  nonprovisional  application  is  entitled  to  the  benefit  of  the  filing date of the parent nonprovisional application.

Answer (A) is incorrect.  The prior art exclusion in 35 U.S.C. § 103(c) cannot obviate  rejections  made  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  706.02(l)(1).    Answer  (B)  is  incorrect.    The  prior  art  exclusion  in  35  U.S.C.  §  103(c)  cannot  obviate  double  patenting  rejections.  See MPEP §§ 706.02(l)(1) and (l)(3). 
10585	(E) All of the above.	919	f	11. ANSWER: The correct answer is (C). See MPEP § 706.02(l) et seq. In accordance with proper USPTO policy and procedure, the prior art exclusion of 35 U.S.C. § 103(c) can only be invoked when the reference only qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(f), 35 U.S.C. § 102(g), or 35 USC 102(e) for applications filed on or after November 29, 1999, the application and the reference were commonly owned, or subject to an assignment to the same person, at the time the invention was made, and the reference was used in an obviousness rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a).  Answer (A) is incorrect.  The prior art exclusion in 35 U.S.C. § 103(c) cannot obviate  rejections  made  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  706.02(l)(1).    Answer  (B)  is  incorrect.    The  prior  art  exclusion  in  35  U.S.C.  §  103(c)  cannot  obviate  double  patenting  rejections.  See MPEP §§ 706.02(l)(1) and (l)(3). 
10605	(E) All of the above.	923	f	15. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer. The filing of an amendment complying with 37 CFR § 1.116 is a proper reply under 37 CFR § 1.113 to a final rejection. See MPEP § 714.13, under the heading “Entry Not A Matter of Right,” which states, in pertinent part , “A reply under 37  CFR  1.113  is  limited  to:  (A)  an  amendment  complying  with  37  CFR  1.116.”    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  the  Notice  of  Appeal  must  be  accompanied  by  the  appeal  fee  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.17(b).  (C)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  the  RCE  must  be  accompanied  by  a  submission  (i.e.,  an  amendment  that  meets  the  reply  requirement  of  37  CFR  §  1.111).    (D)  is  not  the  correct  answer  because  CPA  practice  does  not  apply  to  utility  or  plant  applications  if  the  prior  application  has  a  filing  date  on  or  after  May  29,  2000.  See  MPEP  § 706.07(h), paragraphs I and IV. (E) is not the correct answer since (A) is a proper reply.  
11554	(A)R is selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, or D.	1114	t	see 2173.05(h)
10586	(A) Inventor C, who has not signed the oath or declaration, may revoke the power of\nattorney to practitioner E and appoint practitioner F to prosecute the application.	920	f	12. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states “[t]he assignee of record of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  may  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice. See 37 CFR § 3.71. Such intervention, however,  does  not  exclude  the  applicant  from  access  to  the  application  to  see  that  it  is  being  prosecuted properly, unless the assignee makes specific request to that effect.”  (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect.  MPEP § 409.03(i) is directly contrary to answer (A), and provides that a non-signing  inventor  cannot  revoke  or  give  a  power  of  attorney  without  agreement  of  all  named  inventors or the 37 CFR § 1.47(b) applicant.  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 106 does not empower an inventor  who  has  assigned  his  or  her  rights  to  exclude  a  non-signing  joint  inventor  from  accessing an application in which the latter party is named as a joint inventor.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  106.    Corporation  D,  as  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest,  cannot  exclude  the  non-signing  joint inventor from access to the application. See also, MPEP § 106.01, which states “While it is only  the  assignee  of  record  of  the  entire  interest  who  can  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  an  application  or  interference  to  the  exclusion  of  the  applicant,  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest  or  a  licensee of exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.”  (D) is incorrect because MPEP §  409.03(i)  states  that  a  nonsigning  inventor  is  entitled  to  inspect  any  papers  in  the  application,  and order copies at the price set forth in 37 C FR § 1.19.
10587	(B) Inventor C cannot be excluded from access t the application because inventor B\nhas not agreed to exclude inventor C. In order to exclude a co-inventor from\naccess to an application, all the remaining inventors must agree to exclude that coinventor.	920	f	12. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states “[t]he assignee of record of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  may  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice. See 37 CFR § 3.71. Such intervention, however,  does  not  exclude  the  applicant  from  access  to  the  application  to  see  that  it  is  being  prosecuted properly, unless the assignee makes specific request to that effect.”  (A), (B), (D), and (E) are incorrect.  MPEP § 409.03(i) is directly contrary to answer (A), and provides that a non-signing  inventor  cannot  revoke  or  give  a  power  of  attorney  without  agreement  of  all  named  inventors or the 37 CFR § 1.47(b) applicant.  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 106 does not empower an inventor  who  has  assigned  his  or  her  rights  to  exclude  a  non-signing  joint  inventor  from  accessing an application in which the latter party is named as a joint inventor.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  106.    Corporation  D,  as  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest,  cannot  exclude  the  non-signing  joint inventor from access to the application. See also, MPEP § 106.01, which states “While it is only  the  assignee  of  record  of  the  entire  interest  who  can  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  an  application  or  interference  to  the  exclusion  of  the  applicant,  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest  or  a  licensee of exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.”  (D) is incorrect because MPEP §  409.03(i)  states  that  a  nonsigning  inventor  is  entitled  to  inspect  any  papers  in  the  application,  and order copies at the price set forth in 37 C FR § 1.19.
10588	(C) Inasmuch as one of the named joint inventors has not assigned his or her rights to\nCorporation D, the corporation is not an assignee of the entire right and interest,\nand therefore cannot exclude inventor C from access to the application.	920	t	12. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states “[t]he assignee of record of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  may  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice. See 37 CFR § 3.71.

MPEP § 409.03(i) is directly contrary to answer (A), and provides that a non-signing  inventor  cannot  revoke  or  give  a  power  of  attorney  without  agreement  of  all  named  inventors or the 37 CFR § 1.47(b) applicant.  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 106 does not empower an inventor  who  has  assigned  his  or  her  rights  to  exclude  a  non-signing  joint  inventor  from  accessing an application in which the latter party is named as a joint inventor.  (E) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  106.    Corporation  D,  as  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest,  cannot  exclude  the  non-signing  joint inventor from access to the application. See also, MPEP § 106.01, which states “While it is only  the  assignee  of  record  of  the  entire  interest  who  can  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  an  application  or  interference  to  the  exclusion  of  the  applicant,  an  assignee  of  a  part  interest  or  a  licensee of exclusive right is entitled to inspect the application.”  (D) is incorrect because MPEP §  409.03(i)  states  that  a  nonsigning  inventor  is  entitled  to  inspect  any  papers  in  the  application,  and order copies at the price set forth in 37 C FR § 1.19.
10589	(D) An inventor who did not sign the oath or declaration filed in an application can\nalways be excluded from access to an application.	920	f	12. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states “[t]he assignee of record of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  may  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice. See 37 CFR § 3.71.

10785	(E) Any drawing required by 37 CFR 1.81(a). 	959	f	1.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01. As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the filing fee for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)  can  be  submitted  after  the  filing  date.(B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.  37  CFR  § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.   37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.81(a)  are  filed  in  the  Office.    Thus,  (B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  needed  to  obtain  a  filing  date.
10590	(E) An assignee filing an application can control access to an application and exclude\ninventors who have not assigned their rights and other assignees from inspecting\nthe application.	920	f	12. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 106 states “[t]he assignee of record of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  may  intervene  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  appointing an attorney or agent of his or her own choice. See 37 CFR § 3.71.

10591	(A) The basic filing fee for a design patent application.	921	f	13. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h); MPEP §§ 302.06; 509.02. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h) specifies that the fees “charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced by 50 percent with respect to their application to any small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act, and to any independent inventor or nonprofit organization as defined in regulations issued by the Director.” Since the fee for a document affecting title is charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 41(d)(1), it not subsection (a) or (b), and it is not entitled to a small entity discount. See also MPEP 509.02, which states, “[o]ther fees, established under section 41 (c) or (d) of Title 35, United States Code, are not reduced for small entities since such a reduction is not permitted or authorized by Public Law 97-247. Fees which are not reduced include . . . miscellaneous fees and charges, 37 CFR 1.21.” Fees for recording documents affecting title are set under 37 CFR § 1.21(h). See MPEP § 302.06. (A) is entitled to a small entity discount because it is a fee charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 41(a)(3)(A). (B) is entitled to a small entity discount because it is charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 41(a)(5). (C) is entitled to a small entity discount because it is charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 41(a)(8).

10592	(B) The fee for a disclaimer.	921	f	13. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h); MPEP §§ 302.06; 509.02. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h) specifies that the fees “charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced by 50 percent with respect to their application to any small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act, and to any independent inventor or nonprofit organization as defined in regulations issued by the Director.” Since the fee for a document affecting title is charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 41(d)(1), it not subsection (a) or (b), and it is not entitled to a small entity discount.

10594	(D) The fee for recording a document affecting title.	921	t	13. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h); MPEP §§ 302.06; 509.02. 35 U.S.C. § 41(h) specifies that the fees “charged under subsection (a) or (b) shall be reduced by 50 percent with respect to their application to any small business concern as defined under section 3 of the Small Business Act, and to any independent inventor or nonprofit organization as defined in regulations issued by the Director.” Since the fee for a document affecting title is charged pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 41(d)(1), it not subsection (a) or (b), and it is not entitled to a small entity discount.

10596	(A) appropriate because the claims are not commensurate in scope with the breadth of\nenablement inasmuch as the working examples in the application are narrow\ncompared to the wide breadth of the claims, the unpredictability of the\ntechnology, the high quantity of experimentation needed to practice the\ntechnology in cells other than E. coli.	922	t	14. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph; MPEP §§ 2164.01 and 2164.06(b). MPEP § 2164.01 states “[t]he standard for determining whether the specification meets the enablement requirement was cast in the Supreme Court decision of Mineral Separation v. Hyde, 242 U.S. 261, 270 (1916) which postured the question: is the experimentation needed to practice the invention undue or unreasonable? That standard is still the one to be applied. In re Wands , 858 F.2d 731, 737, 8 USPQ2d 1400, 1404 (Fed. Cir. 1988). Accordingly, even though the statute does not use the term ‘undue experimentation,’ it has been interpreted to require that the claimed invention be enabled so that any person skilled in the art can  make  and  use  the  invention  without  undue  experimentation.”    See  also  the  discussion  of  Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Calgene, Inc., 52 USPQ2d 1129 (Fed. Cir. 1999) in MPEP § 2164.06(b).  (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “III.  Therapeutic  Or  Pharmacological  Utility,”  states  “[t]he  Federal  Circuit  has  reiterated  that  therapeutic  utility  sufficient  under  the  patent  laws  is  not  to  be  confused  with  the  requirements  of  the  FDA  with  regard  to  safety  and  efficacy  of  drugs  to  marketed  in  the  United  States.  .  .  In  re  Brana,  51  F.3d  1560,  34  USPQ2d  1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe 35 U.S.C. 101, under the  logic  of  ‘practical’  utility  or  otherwise,  to  require  that  an  applicant  demonstrate  that  a  therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans.” (C) is  incorrect.    35  U.S.C.  §  112,  first  paragraph;  MPEP  §  2107.02.    MPEP  §  2107.02,  under  the  heading  “When  Is  An  Asserted  Utility  Not  Credible,”  states  “Rejections  under  35  U.S.C.  101  have  been  rarely  sustained  by  federal  courts.

See MPEP § 714.13, under the heading “Entry Not A Matter of Right,” which states, in pertinent part , “A reply under 37  CFR  1.113  is  limited  to:  (A)  an  amendment  complying  with  37  CFR  1.116.”    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  the  Notice  of  Appeal  must  be  accompanied  by  the  appeal  fee  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.17(b).  (C)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  the  RCE  must  be  accompanied  by  a  submission  (i.e.,  an  amendment  that  meets  the  reply  requirement  of  37  CFR  §  1.111).    (D)  is  not  the  correct  answer  because  CPA  practice  does  not  apply  to  utility  or  plant  applications  if  the  prior  application  has  a  filing  date  on  or  after  May  29,  2000.  See  MPEP  § 706.07(h), paragraphs I and IV. (E) is not the correct answer since (A) is a proper reply.  
11555	(B) R is selected from the group consisting of A, B, C, and D.	1114	t	2173.05(h)
11579	(A)Where joint inventors are named, the examiner should not inquire of the patent applicant concerning the inventors and the invention dates for the subject matter of the various claims until it becomes necessary to do so in order to properly examine the application.	1119	f	(D) see MPEP 213.
10606	(A) Tribell should file a reissue application under 35 USC 251 within two years of the\nissuance of the patent, broadening the scope of the claims of the issued patent.	924	t	16.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  251,  MPEP  §  1402  (fifth  paragraph).  MPEP  §  1402  states  that  one  of  the  “most  common  bases  for  filing  a  reissue application [is] (A) the claims are too narrow or too broad.”  The claims may be broadened in a reissue  application  filed  by  the  inventor  within  two  years  from  the  patent  issue  date.    (B)  is  incorrect since the 4th paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 251 states that no reissued patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the clams of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the  grant  of  the  original  patent.    (C)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.    MPEP  §  1402,  sixteenth  paragraph.    An applicant’s failure to timely file a divisional application while the original application is still pending is not considered to be an error correctable via reissue.  See In re Orita, 550 F.2d 1277, 1280,  193  USPQ  145,  148  (CCPA  1977).  (D)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  201.06.    In  order  to  claim  benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to a parent application, a divisional application must be filed while the parent patent application is still pending.  
10607	(B) Tribell should file a reissue application under 35 USC 251any time during the\nperiod of enforceability of the patent to broaden the scope of the claims of the\nissued patent, and then file a divisional reissue application of the first reissue\napplication on the nonelected claims that were subjected to a restriction\nrequirement in the nonprovisional application which issued as a patent.	924	f	16.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  251,  MPEP  §  1402  (fifth  paragraph).  MPEP  §  1402  states  that  one  of  the  “most  common  bases  for  filing  a  reissue application [is] (A) the claims are too narrow or too broad.”  The claims may be broadened in a reissue  application  filed  by  the  inventor  within  two  years  from  the  patent  issue  date.    (B)  is  incorrect since the 4th paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 251 states that no reissued patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the clams of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the  grant  of  the  original  patent.    (C)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.    MPEP  §  1402,  sixteenth  paragraph.    An applicant’s failure to timely file a divisional application while the original application is still pending is not considered to be an error correctable via reissue.  See In re Orita, 550 F.2d 1277, 1280,  193  USPQ  145,  148  (CCPA  1977).  (D)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  201.06.    In  order  to  claim  benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to a parent application, a divisional application must be filed while the parent patent application is still pending.  
10608	(C) Tribell should simultaneously file two separate reissue applications under\n35 USC 251, one including an amendment of broadening the claims in the\noriginal patent, and the other including the nonelected claims that were subjected\nto a restriction requirement in the nonprovisional application which issued as a\npatent.	924	f	16.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  251,  MPEP  §  1402  (fifth  paragraph).  MPEP  §  1402  states  that  one  of  the  “most  common  bases  for  filing  a  reissue application [is] (A) the claims are too narrow or too broad.”  The claims may be broadened in a reissue  application  filed  by  the  inventor  within  two  years  from  the  patent  issue  date.

In  order  to  claim  benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 120 to a parent application, a divisional application must be filed while the parent patent application is still pending.  
10609	(D) Tribell should immediately file a divisional application under 37 CFR 1.53(b)\nincluding the nonelected claims that were subjected to a restriction requirement in\nthe original application.	924	f	16.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  251,  MPEP  §  1402  (fifth  paragraph).  MPEP  §  1402  states  that  one  of  the  “most  common  bases  for  filing  a  reissue application [is] (A) the claims are too narrow or too broad.”  The claims may be broadened in a reissue  application  filed  by  the  inventor  within  two  years  from  the  patent  issue  date.

10821	(A)  A  rejection  of  application  claims  for  obviousness-type  double  patenting  over  the  claims of a patent which names a different inventive entity (where one inventor is in  common  with  the  inventive  entity  in  the  application)  and  was  not  commonly  owned  at  the  time  applicant  made  his  or  her  invention  can  be  overcome  with  an  affidavit  or  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.131  showing  that  the  applicant  made  the  invention in the United States prior to the effective filing date of the patent.  	967	t	9. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS.  
10611	(A) I and II only.	925	t	17.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2144.03  provides  that  when  an  applicant  seasonably  traverses  an  officially  noticed  fact,  the  examiner  may  cite  a  reference  teaching the noticed fact and make the next action final.  Here, applicant did seasonably traverse the  noticed  fact  by  demanding  proof  in  response  to  the  rejection.    II  is  therefore  an  appropriate  action  by  the  examiner.    I  is  also  an  appropriate  action  because  the  examiner  should  vacate  a  rejection based on official notice if no support for the noticed fact can be found in response to a challenge by the applicant.

10616	(A) The level of disclosure required for a reference to be enabling prior art is no less if\nthe reference is a United States patent than if it is a foreign patent.	926	t	18. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2121, under the heading “What Constitutes An ‘Enabling Disclosure’ Does Not Depend On The Type Of Prior Art The Disclosure Is Contained In,” states, in reliance upon In re Moreton, 288 F.2d 708, 711, 129 USPQ 227, 230 (CCPA 1961): “The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an ‘enabling disclosure’ is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue.... There is no basis in the statute (35 U.S.C. 102 or 103) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art references on the basis of nationality.” Answer (B) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121, under the heading “Prior Art Is Presumed To Be Operable/Enabling,” states that “[w]hen the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable.” Answer (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121.01, under the heading “35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections And Use Of Inoperative Prior Art,” quotes Symbol Technologies Inc. v. Opticon Inc., 935 F.2d 1569, 1578, 19 USPQ2d 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991) as stating that “a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103.” Answer (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121.01 states that “[a] reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’ if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of invention.” Answer (E) is incorrect because answers (B), (C) and (D) are incorrect.
10617	(B) A reference is not presumed to be operable merely because it expressly anticipates\nor makes obvious all limitations of an applicant’s claimed apparatus.	926	f	18.

MPEP § 2121.01 states that “[a] reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’ if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of invention.” Answer (E) is incorrect because answers (B), (C) and (D) are incorrect.
10619	(D) A reference does not provide an enabling disclosure merely by showing that the\npublic was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of the\napplicant’s invention.	926	f	18.

MPEP § 2121.01 states that “[a] reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’ if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of invention.” Answer (E) is incorrect because answers (B), (C) and (D) are incorrect.
10695	(E) “the area of the rectangle being ...,” where the claim does not previously define an\n“area.”	941	f	33. ANSWER: (D) is correct. "Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent basis in the recitation of the components themselves." MPEP § 2173.05(e). The MPEP provides an analogous example: "the limitation 'the outer surface of said sphere' would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere have an outer surface." Id. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all examples of things which inherently have the claimed characteristic and do not have an antecedent basis problem; that is, all circles have a center, all ellipses have a major diameter, all spheres have an outer surface, and all rectangles have an area, and these characteristics need not be provided with express antecedent basis. The ellipse example is from Bose Corp. v. JBL Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("There can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of an ellipse is a major diameter."). The lever recited in (D) is not an inherent component of a machine and therefore requires express antecedent basis. 
10620	(E) All of the above are correct.	926	f	18. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2121, under the heading “What Constitutes An ‘Enabling Disclosure’ Does Not Depend On The Type Of Prior Art The Disclosure Is Contained In,” states, in reliance upon In re Moreton, 288 F.2d 708, 711, 129 USPQ 227, 230 (CCPA 1961): “The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an ‘enabling disclosure’ is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue.... There is no basis in the statute (35 U.S.C. 102 or 103) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art references on the basis of nationality.” Answer (B) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121, under the heading “Prior Art Is Presumed To Be Operable/Enabling,” states that “[w]hen the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable.” Answer (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121.01, under the heading “35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections And Use Of Inoperative Prior Art,” quotes Symbol Technologies Inc. v. Opticon Inc., 935 F.2d 1569, 1578, 19 USPQ2d 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991) as stating that “a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining obviousness under 35 U.S.C. 103.” Answer (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 2121.01 states that “[a] reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’ if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the date of invention.” Answer (E) is incorrect because answers (B), (C) and (D) are incorrect.
10621	(A) the reference is nonanalogous art.	927	f	19. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As set forth in MPEP § 2131.05, “‘Arguments that the alleged anticipatory prior art is ‘nonanalogous art’ or ‘teaches away from the invention’ or is not recognized as solving the problem solved by the claimed invention, [are] not  ‘germane’  to  a  rejection  under  section  102.’    Twin  Disc,  Inc.  v.  United  States,  231  USPQ  417,  424  (Cl.Ct.1986)  (quoting  In  re  Self,  671  F.2d  1344,  213  USPQ  1,  7  (CCPA  1982)).    A  reference is no less anticipatory if, after disclosing the invention, the reference then disparages it.  The  question  whether  a  reference  ‘teaches  away’  from  the  invention  is  inapplicable  to  an  anticipation  analysis.  Celeritas  Technologies  Ltd.  v.  Rockwell  International  Corp.,  150  F.3d  1354,  1361,  47  USPQ2d  1516,  1522-23  (Fed.Cir.1999).”    Therefore,  answers  (A)  through  (D)  are  incorrect.

10622	(B) the reference teaches away from the claimed invention.	927	f	19. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As set forth in MPEP § 2131.05, “‘Arguments that the alleged anticipatory prior art is ‘nonanalogous art’ or ‘teaches away from the invention’ or is not recognized as solving the problem solved by the claimed invention, [are] not  ‘germane’  to  a  rejection  under  section  102.’    Twin  Disc,  Inc.  v.

10713	(C) Antedate the applied patent by filing a declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 showing\nthat applicant invented the claimed subject matter prior to the effective date of the\napplied patent.	945	f	37.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  37  CFR  §  1.111(b);  MPEP  §§ 706.02(b), 2131 and 2131.03.  As stated in MPEP 2131, under the heading “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim,” “A claim is anticipated only if each  and  every  element  as  set  forth  in  the  claim  is  found,  either  expressly  or  inherently  described, in a single prior art reference.”  Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d  628,  631,  2  USPQ2d  1051,  1053  (Fed.  Cir.  1987).    MPEP  2131.03,  under  the  heading,  “Prior  Art  Which  Teaches  A  Range  Within,  Overlapping,  Or  Touching  The  Claimed  Range  Anticipates If The Prior Art Range Discloses The Claimed Range With ‘Sufficient Specificity.’” states  “When  the  prior  art  discloses  a  range  which  touches,  overlaps  or  is  within  the  claimed  range,  but  no  specific  examples  falling  within  the  claimed  range  are  disclosed,  a  case  by  case  determination  must  be  made  as  to  anticipation.  In  order  to  anticipate  the  claims,  the  claimed  subject  matter  must  be  disclosed  in  the  reference  with  ‘sufficient  specificity  to  constitute  an  anticipation under the statute.’”  A claim containing a limitation that the grit particle size is 5-7 microns  would  not  be  anticipated  by  the  applied  reference,  because  the  applied  reference  discloses a different grit particle size well outside that range.  (A) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2123(8thEd.).    Patents  are  relevant  as  prior  art  for  all  they  contain  and  are  not  limited  to  their  preferred  embodiments.  See In re Heck, 699 F.2d 1331, 1332-33, 216 USPQ 1038, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and Merck  &  Co.  v.  Biocraft  Laboratories,  874  F.2d  804,  10  USPQ2d  1843  (Fed.  Cir.  1989),  cert.  denied,  493  U.S.  975  (1989).    (B)  is  incorrect.    See  MPEP  §  2131.04.    Evidence  of  secondary  considerations  such  as  unexpected  results  is  irrelevant  to  35  U.S.C.  §  102  rejections  and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based.  See In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543,179 USPQ 421, 425 (CCPA 1973).  (C) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 715, under the heading “Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits or Declarations Are Inappropriate.”  An affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.131 is inappropriate where the reference publication date is more than 1 year prior to applicant’s effective filing date.  Such a reference is a “statutory bar” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as referenced in 37 CFR § 1.131(a)(2).  (D) is also incorrect.  See MPEP § 2131.05.  Argumentsthat  the  alleged  anticipatory  prior  art  is  “nonanalogous  art”  are  not  “germane”  to  a  rejection  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102.    Twin  Disc,  Inc.  v.  United  States,  231  USPQ  417,  424  (Cl.  Ct.  1986)  (quoting In re Self, 671 F.2d 1344, 213 USPQ 1, 7 (CCPA 1982).
11205	(E)  The  subject  matter  found  in  the  original  claims,  but  lacking  in  the  drawing  or  detailed  description,  must  be  sufficiently  specific  and  detailed  to  support  an  amendment of the drawing and detailed description. 	1043	f	35.  ANSWER:  (C).   According to MPEP § 608.01(l), “[t]he claim should not be attacked either by objection or rejection because this subject matter is lacking in the drawing and description.”  As to (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(l).
10626	(A) The practitioner files the missing drawing figure in response to the Notice of\nOmitted Item(s) within the time period set forth in the notice.	928	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 201.06(c), under the heading “INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE”, subheading “B. Application Entitled to a Filing Date,” states that “[i]f the application as originally filed includes a proper incorporation by reference of the prior application(s), an omitted specification page(s) and/or drawing figure(s) identified in a “Notice of Omitted Item(s)” may be added by amendment provided the omitted item(s) contains only subject matter in common with such prior application(s). In such case applicant need notrespond to the “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” Applicant should submit the amendment adding the omitted material prior to the first Office action to avoid delays in the prosecution of the application.” (A) and (B) are incorrect because the application filing date will be the date of the filing of the missing drawing figure. See MPEP § 601.01(g). Furthermore, a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. § 120 in a continuation or divisional application does not amount to an incorporation by reference of the application to which priority is claimed. See MPEP § 201.06(c). (C) is incorrect. The continuation application will not be accorded with a filing date of January 3, 2003 with the missing drawing figure. (E) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.53(e) will not be granted if the missing drawing figure is inadvertently omitted by the applicant and not in fact deposited with the USPTO with the application papers.
10627	(B) The practitioner files the missing drawing figure and an amendment to the\nspecification to add a complete description of the missing drawing figure in\nresponse to the Notice of Omitted Item(s) within the time period set forth in the\nnotice.	928	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 201.06(c), under the heading “INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE”, subheading “B. Application Entitled to a Filing Date,” states that “[i]f the application as originally filed includes a proper incorporation by reference of the prior application(s), an omitted specification page(s) and/or drawing figure(s) identified in a “Notice of Omitted Item(s)” may be added by amendment provided the omitted item(s) contains only subject matter in common with such prior application(s). In such case applicant need notrespond to the “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” Applicant should submit the amendment adding the omitted material prior to the first Office action to avoid delays in the prosecution of the application.” (A) and (B) are incorrect because the application filing date will be the date of the filing of the missing drawing figure. See MPEP § 601.01(g). Furthermore, a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. § 120 in a continuation or divisional application does not amount to an incorporation by reference of the application to which priority is claimed. See MPEP § 201.06(c). (C) is incorrect. The continuation application will not be accorded with a filing date of January 3, 2003 with the missing drawing figure. (E) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.53(e) will not be granted if the missing drawing figure is inadvertently omitted by the applicant and not in fact deposited with the USPTO with the application papers.
10628	(C) The practitioner files an amendment to cancel the description of the missing\ndrawing figure from the specification of the continuation application.	928	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 201.06(c), under the heading “INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE”, subheading “B. Application Entitled to a Filing Date,” states that “[i]f the application as originally filed includes a proper incorporation by reference of the prior application(s), an omitted specification page(s) and/or drawing figure(s) identified in a “Notice of Omitted Item(s)” may be added by amendment provided the omitted item(s) contains only subject matter in common with such prior application(s). In such case applicant need notrespond to the “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” Applicant should submit the amendment adding the omitted material prior to the first Office action to avoid delays in the prosecution of the application.” (A) and (B) are incorrect because the application filing date will be the date of the filing of the missing drawing figure. See MPEP § 601.01(g). Furthermore, a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. § 120 in a continuation or divisional application does not amount to an incorporation by reference of the application to which priority is claimed. See MPEP § 201.06(c). (C) is incorrect. The continuation application will not be accorded with a filing date of January 3, 2003 with the missing drawing figure. (E) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.53(e) will not be granted if the missing drawing figure is inadvertently omitted by the applicant and not in fact deposited with the USPTO with the application papers.
10629	(D) If the continuation application as originally filed includes an incorporation by\nreference of the prior-filed application to which the benefit is claimed, the\npractitioner can file the missing drawing figure any time prior to the first Office\naction.	928	t	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 201.06(c), under the heading “INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE”, subheading “B. Application Entitled to a Filing Date,” states that “[i]f the application as originally filed includes a proper incorporation by reference of the prior application(s), an omitted specification page(s) and/or drawing figure(s) identified in a “Notice of Omitted Item(s)” may be added by amendment provided the omitted item(s) contains only subject matter in common with such prior application(s). In such case applicant need notrespond to the “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” Applicant should submit the amendment adding the omitted material prior to the first Office action to avoid delays in the prosecution of the application.” (A) and (B) are incorrect because the application filing date will be the date of the filing of the missing drawing figure. See MPEP § 601.01(g). Furthermore, a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. § 120 in a continuation or divisional application does not amount to an incorporation by reference of the application to which priority is claimed. See MPEP § 201.06(c). (C) is incorrect. The continuation application will not be accorded with a filing date of January 3, 2003 with the missing drawing figure. (E) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.53(e) will not be granted if the missing drawing figure is inadvertently omitted by the applicant and not in fact deposited with the USPTO with the application papers.
10824	(D)  Application  claims  are  properly  rejected  for  obviousness-type  double  patenting  over  claims  of  a  patent  having  an  effective  filing  date  earlier  than  the  effective  filing  date  of  the  application  only  if  both  of  the  following  two  conditions  are  satisfied:    (a)  the  rejected  application  claims  recite  an  obvious  variation  of  the  subject matter recited in the patent claims on which the rejection is based; and (b) the patent claims on which the rejection is based recite an obvious variation of the subject matter recited in the rejected application claims. 	967	t	9. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS.  
10825	(E) None of statements (A) though (D) is correct. 	967	t	9. CREDIT GIVEN FOR ALL ANSWERS.  
11556	(C) R is selected from the group comprising A, B, C, and D.	1114	f	see MPEP 2173.05(h)
10630	(E) The practitioner files the missing drawing figure accompanied by a petition under\n37 CFR 1.53(e) with the petition fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(h) only alleging that\nthe drawing figure indicated as omitted was in fact deposited with the USPTO\nwith the application papers.	928	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 201.06(c), under the heading “INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE”, subheading “B. Application Entitled to a Filing Date,” states that “[i]f the application as originally filed includes a proper incorporation by reference of the prior application(s), an omitted specification page(s) and/or drawing figure(s) identified in a “Notice of Omitted Item(s)” may be added by amendment provided the omitted item(s) contains only subject matter in common with such prior application(s). In such case applicant need notrespond to the “Notice of Omitted Item(s).” Applicant should submit the amendment adding the omitted material prior to the first Office action to avoid delays in the prosecution of the application.” (A) and (B) are incorrect because the application filing date will be the date of the filing of the missing drawing figure. See MPEP § 601.01(g). Furthermore, a priority claim under 35 U.S.C. § 120 in a continuation or divisional application does not amount to an incorporation by reference of the application to which priority is claimed. See MPEP § 201.06(c). (C) is incorrect. The continuation application will not be accorded with a filing date of January 3, 2003 with the missing drawing figure. (E) is incorrect because a petition under 37 CFR § 1.53(e) will not be granted if the missing drawing figure is inadvertently omitted by the applicant and not in fact deposited with the USPTO with the application papers.
10631	(A) Filing a declaration and exhibits under 37 CFR 1.131 to antedate the reference\nU.S. patent.	929	f	21. ANSWER: (D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 U.S.C. § 120 by amending the specification of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a statutory bar. See 37 CFR § 1.131(a); MPEP § 715, “SITUATIONS WHERE 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVITS OR DECLARATIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE.” Answers (B) and (C) are incorrect because, as noted in MPEP § 2131.04, evidence of secondary considerations, such as unexpected results or commercial success, is irrelevant to 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based. In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543, 179 USPQ 421, 425 (CCPA 1973). Answer (E) is incorrect because to serve as an anticipation when the reference is silent about an asserted inherent characteristic, such gap in the reference may be filled with recourse to extrinsic evidence. Continental Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264, 1268, 20 USPQ2d 1746, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See also MPEP § 2131.01, “Multiple Reference 35 U.S.C. 102 Rejections.” 
10632	(B) Filing evidence under 37 CFR 1.132 tending to show commercial success of the\ninvention.	929	f	21. ANSWER: (D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 U.S.C. § 120 by amending the specification of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a statutory bar. See 37 CFR § 1.131(a); MPEP § 715, “SITUATIONS WHERE 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVITS OR DECLARATIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE.” Answers (B) and (C) are incorrect because, as noted in MPEP § 2131.04, evidence of secondary considerations, such as unexpected results or commercial success, is irrelevant to 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based.

10633	(C) Filing evidence under 37 CFR 1.132 tending to show unexpected results of the\ninvention.	929	f	21. ANSWER: (D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 U.S.C. § 120 by amending the specification of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a statutory bar.

10634	(D) Amending the specification of application A to claim priority under 35 USC 120\nby a specific reference to a prior copending application B that was filed before\nJune 2, 1992 by the same inventor and discloses the invention claimed in at least\none claim of application A in the manner provided by the first paragraph of 35\nUSC 112.	929	t	21. ANSWER: (D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 U.S.C. § 120 by amending the specification of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a statutory bar. See 37 CFR § 1.131(a); MPEP § 715, “SITUATIONS WHERE 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVITS OR DECLARATIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE.” Answers (B) and (C) are incorrect because, as noted in MPEP § 2131.04, evidence of secondary considerations, such as unexpected results or commercial success, is irrelevant to 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based. In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543, 179 USPQ 421, 425 (CCPA 1973). Answer (E) is incorrect because to serve as an anticipation when the reference is silent about an asserted inherent characteristic, such gap in the reference may be filled with recourse to extrinsic evidence. Continental Can Co. USA v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264, 1268, 20 USPQ2d 1746, 1749 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See also MPEP § 2131.01, “Multiple Reference 35 U.S.C. 102 Rejections.”

10635	(E) Submitting arguments pointing out that the rejection under 35 USC 102(b) relies\non more than one reference.	929	f	21. ANSWER: (D) is most correct. MPEP § 706.02(b) (8th ed., Rev. 1) states that “[a] rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) may be overcome by...(C) perfecting priority under...35 U.S.C. § 120 by amending the specification of the application to contain a specific reference to a prior application...” Answer (A) is incorrect because a declaration and evidence filed under 37 CFR § 1.131 cannot antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b), a statutory bar. See 37 CFR § 1.131(a); MPEP § 715, “SITUATIONS WHERE 37 CFR 1.131 AFFIDAVITS OR DECLARATIONS ARE INAPPROPRIATE.” Answers (B) and (C) are incorrect because, as noted in MPEP § 2131.04, evidence of secondary considerations, such as unexpected results or commercial success, is irrelevant to 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejections and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based.

10636	(A) No, a copy cannot be obtained because patent applications are maintained in\nconfidence pursuant to 35 USC 122(a).	930	f	22. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written  request  and  payment  of  the  fee.”    (A),  and  (B)  are  not  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.14(c)(2).    Once  an  application  has  been  published,  a  copy  is  available  to  the  public  upon  written  request  and payment of a fee. (C) and (D) are not correct. As stated in MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published  U.S.  Patent  Applications,”  if  the  published  patent  application  is  pending,  the  application file itself will not be available to the public for inspection.”
10637	(B) No, a copy cannot be obtained because the patent application is still pending.	930	f	22. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written  request  and  payment  of  the  fee.”    (A),  and  (B)  are  not  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.14(c)(2).    Once  an  application  has  been  published,  a  copy  is  available  to  the  public  upon  written  request  and payment of a fee. (C) and (D) are not correct.

10638	(C) Yes, a member of the public can go to the Technology Center and ask for the file\nfor copying at a public photocopier.	930	f	22. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written  request  and  payment  of  the  fee.”    (A),  and  (B)  are  not  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.14(c)(2).    Once  an  application  has  been  published,  a  copy  is  available  to  the  public  upon  written  request  and payment of a fee. (C) and (D) are not correct. As stated in MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published  U.S.  Patent  Applications,”  if  the  published  patent  application  is  pending,  the  application file itself will not be available to the public for inspection.”
10639	(D) Yes, the member of the public can complete a “Request for Access to an\nApplication Under 37 CFR 1.14(e)” and, without payment of a fee, order the file\nfrom the File Information Unit. Upon the Unit’s receipt of the application, the\nmember of the public can use a public photocopier to make a copy.	930	f	22. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written  request  and  payment  of  the  fee.”    (A),  and  (B)  are  not  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.14(c)(2).    Once  an  application  has  been  published,  a  copy  is  available  to  the  public  upon  written  request  and payment of a fee. (C) and (D) are not correct. As stated in MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published  U.S.  Patent  Applications,”  if  the  published  patent  application  is  pending,  the  application file itself will not be available to the public for inspection.”
10640	(E) Yes, the member of the public can order a copy from the Office of Public\nRecords, with a written request and payment of the appropriate fee.	930	t	22. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published U.S. Patent Applications” states that “If a patent application has been published pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 122(b), then a copy of the specification, drawings, and all papers relating to the file of that published application (whether abandoned or pending) may be provided to any person upon written  request  and  payment  of  the  fee.”    (A),  and  (B)  are  not  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.14(c)(2).    Once  an  application  has  been  published,  a  copy  is  available  to  the  public  upon  written  request  and payment of a fee. (C) and (D) are not correct. As stated in MPEP § 103, under the heading “Published  U.S.  Patent  Applications,”  if  the  published  patent  application  is  pending,  the  application file itself will not be available to the public for inspection.”
10692	(B) “the major diameter of the ellipse being ...,” where the claim does not previously\nrecite that the ellipse has a “major diameter.”	941	f	33. ANSWER: (D) is correct. "Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent basis in the recitation of the components themselves." MPEP § 2173.05(e). The MPEP provides an analogous example: "the limitation 'the outer surface of said sphere' would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere have an outer surface." Id. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all examples of things which inherently have the claimed characteristic and do not have an antecedent basis problem; that is, all circles have a center, all ellipses have a major diameter, all spheres have an outer surface, and all rectangles have an area, and these characteristics need not be provided with express antecedent basis. The ellipse example is from Bose Corp. v. JBL Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("There can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of an ellipse is a major diameter."). The lever recited in (D) is not an inherent component of a machine and therefore requires express antecedent basis. 
10641	(A) An argument explaining that since act (5) is not disclosed in the reference, it does\nnot anticipate the claim.	931	f	23. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (in banc), and MPEP  §  2181,  under  the  heading  “Written  Description  Necessary  To  Support  A  Claim  Limitation Which Invokes 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph,” "step" plus function limitations shall be construed to cover the corresponding acts disclosed in the specification and their equivalents. Accordingly,  the  step  plus  function  imitation  correspondingly  includes  acts  (1)-(5)  and  their  equivalents.  Thus, in order to anticipate, a prior art reference must disclose each and every act, or its equivalent, for the step plus function.  If the reference is shown to not disclose one of the acts, or its equivalents, then the reference fails to anticipate, which is the answer set forth in (C).  Thus, (C) is the most complete answer.  (A) is not the most complete answer because acts (1)-(4) are  disclosed  in  the  reference  and  the  equivalent  of  act  (5)  has  to  be  dealt  with,  i.e.,  the  equivalent  of  continuing  to  walk  may  still  be  met  by  the  reference  unless  the  applicant  shows  through  argument  that  the  reference  also  fails  to  contain  any  equivalent  for  act  (5).    Thus,  the  most  complete  answer  is  (C)  as  compared  to  (A).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  once act (5) is removed from the specification, the prior art reference clearly anticipates (since it otherwise expressly has acts (1)-(4) and the other claim limitations) under the above recited facts absent act (5) in the specification.  See Donaldson, 16 F.3d at 1193, 29 USPQ2d at 1849; MPEP § 2181.  (D) is not the most complete answer the prior art still anticipates the claim. (E) is not the most correct answer because it includes two incorrect answer choices, (B) and (D).
10642	(B) An amendment to the specification deleting act (5) – continue walking.	931	f	23. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed.

Thus,  the  most  complete  answer  is  (C)  as  compared  to  (A).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  once act (5) is removed from the specification, the prior art reference clearly anticipates (since it otherwise expressly has acts (1)-(4) and the other claim limitations) under the above recited facts absent act (5) in the specification.  See Donaldson, 16 F.3d at 1193, 29 USPQ2d at 1849; MPEP § 2181.  (D) is not the most complete answer the prior art still anticipates the claim. (E) is not the most correct answer because it includes two incorrect answer choices, (B) and (D).
10643	(C) An argument showing that neither the equivalent of act (5) nor act (5) is disclosed\nin the reference, which therefore does not anticipate the claim.	931	t	23. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed.

See Donaldson, 16 F.3d at 1193, 29 USPQ2d at 1849; MPEP § 2181.  (D) is not the most complete answer the prior art still anticipates the claim. (E) is not the most correct answer because it includes two incorrect answer choices, (B) and (D).
10644	(D) An amendment to the claim by adding a negative limitation to expressly exclude\nact (5) from crossing the road.	931	f	23. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed.

(E) is not the most correct answer because it includes two incorrect answer choices, (B) and (D).
10645	(E) (B) and (D).	931	f	23. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  Pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6, In re Donaldson Co., 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1849 (Fed.

11053	(C)  by  petition  under  37  CFR  1.181  while  the  application  is  pending  before  theexaminer.	1013	t	5.     ANSWER:  (C)  is  most  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181;  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    (A)  and  (B)  are  wrong.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181(a)(1);  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    Prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  is  not  appealable.    37  C.F.R.  §    1.191(a).    (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(c)  states, “Any  question  as  to    prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  should  be  raised,  if  at  all,  while  the  application  is  still  pending  before  the  primary  examiner.”    MPEP  §  1210  indicates  that  jurisdiction is before the Board at the times set forth in (D) and (E). 
10646	(A) An amendment to the claim changing the pulling means to expressly include an\nattached bar.	932	f	24.   ANSWER:    (D)   is   the   most   correct   answer.      MPEP   §   2181   under   the   heading   “Procedures  For  Determining  Whether  The  Written  Description  Adequately  Describes  The  Corresponding  Structure,  Material,  Or  Acts  Necessary  To  Support  A  Claim  Limitation  Which  Invokes  35  U.S.C.  112,  Sixth  Paragraph.”    35  U.S.C.  112,  sixth  paragraph  states  that  a  claim  limitation   expressed   in   means   plus   function   language   “shall   be   construed   to   cover   the   corresponding  structure,  materials,  or  acts  described  in  the  specification  and  ‘equivalents  thereof.’”  See  also  B.  Braun  Medical,  Inc.  v.  Abbott  Lab.,  124  F.3d  1419,  1424,  43  USPQ2d  1896,  1899  (Fed.  Cir.  1997).”  The  examiner  has  made  a  prima  facie  case  of  equivalent  in  the  Office  action  to  support  the  rejection  based  on  35  U.S.C.  §  102.    By  amending  the  claim  to  no  longer  include  the  means  limitation  in  question,  the  claim  becomes  narrower  inasmuch  as  it  no  longer includes equivalents under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6 for examination purposes.  Thus, (D)  overcomes  the  lack  of  novelty  rejection  under  these  circumstances.    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct answer because such an amended claim would continue to lack novelty, since both it and the  prior  art  would  have  the  attached  bar  expressly.    Furthermore,  such  an  amendment  would  introduce new matter lacking support in the application as originally filed.  35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.  (B) is not the most correct answer because the “not found in the prior art” argument does  not  rebut  the  prima  facie  case  of  equivalents  raised  by  the  examiner.    (C)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  it  does  not  address  the  rejection.  (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because the amendment would raise a new matter issue.  
10647	(B) Only argue that the claimed pulling means is not found in the prior art relied-upon\nreference and therefore the claim is patentable.	932	f	24. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2181 under the heading “Procedures For Determining Whether The Written Description Adequately Describes The Corresponding Structure, Material, Or Acts Necessary To Support A Claim Limitation Which Invokes 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph.” 35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph states that a claim limitation expressed in means plus function language “shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, materials, or acts described in the specification and ‘equivalents thereof.’” See also B. Braun Medical, Inc. v. Abbott Lab., 124 F.3d 1419, 1424, 43 USPQ2d 1896, 1899 (Fed. Cir. 1997).” The examiner has made a prima facie case of equivalent in the Office action to support the rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102. By amending the claim to no longer include the means limitation in question, the claim becomes narrower inasmuch as it no longer includes equivalents under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6 for examination purposes. Thus, (D) overcomes the lack of novelty rejection under these circumstances. (A) is not the most correct answer because such an amended claim would continue to lack novelty, since both it and the prior art would have the attached bar expressly. Furthermore, such an amendment would introduce new matter lacking support in the application as originally filed. 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. (B) is not the most correct answer because the “not found in the prior art” argument does not rebut the prima facie case of equivalents raised by the examiner. (C) is not the most correct answer because it does not address the rejection. (E) is not the most correct answer because the amendment would raise a new matter issue. 
10648	(C) An amendment to the specification that adds an attached bar to correspond to the\nprior art.	932	f	24. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2181 under the heading “Procedures For Determining Whether The Written Description Adequately Describes The Corresponding Structure, Material, Or Acts Necessary To Support A Claim Limitation Which Invokes 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph.” 35 U.S.C. 112, sixth paragraph states that a claim limitation expressed in means plus function language “shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, materials, or acts described in the specification and ‘equivalents thereof.’” See also B. Braun Medical, Inc. v. Abbott Lab., 124 F.3d 1419, 1424, 43 USPQ2d 1896, 1899 (Fed. Cir. 1997).” The examiner has made a prima facie case of equivalent in the Office action to support the rejection based on 35 U.S.C. § 102. By amending the claim to no longer include the means limitation in question, the claim becomes narrower inasmuch as it no longer includes equivalents under 35 U.S.C. § 112, paragraph 6 for examination purposes. Thus, (D) overcomes the lack of novelty rejection under these circumstances. (A) is not the most correct answer because such an amended claim would continue to lack novelty, since both it and the prior art would have the attached bar expressly. Furthermore, such an amendment would introduce new matter lacking support in the application as originally filed. 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. (B) is not the most correct answer because the “not found in the prior art” argument does not rebut the prima facie case of equivalents raised by the examiner. (C) is not the most correct answer because it does not address the rejection. (E) is not the most correct answer because the amendment would raise a new matter issue. 
10649	(D) An amendment to the claim substituting for the term “means for pulling the door\nopen” the structure of a handle and a knob.	932	t	24. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.

11054	(D) after 2 months from the examiner’s answer plus mail room time, if no reply brief has  been  timely  filed  during  an  appeal  to  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences.	1013	f	5.     ANSWER:  (C)  is  most  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181;  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    (A)  and  (B)  are  wrong.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181(a)(1);  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    Prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  is  not  appealable.    37  C.F.R.  §    1.191(a).    (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(c)  states, “Any  question  as  to    prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  should  be  raised,  if  at  all,  while  the  application  is  still  pending  before  the  primary  examiner.”    MPEP  §  1210  indicates  that  jurisdiction is before the Board at the times set forth in (D) and (E). 
11558	(E)R is A, B, C, and D.	1114	f	see MPEP 2173.05(h)
10650	(E) An amendment to the specification that excludes an attached bar as a pulling\nmeans.	932	f	24. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.

10651	(A) The patentee would earn PTA because the Office failed to mail at least one\nnotification under 35 USC 132 or notice of allowance under 35 USC 151 no later\nthan fourteen months after the date the application was filed under 35 USC 111(a)\nbut would lose some earned PTA because applicant did not file a response to the\nnon-final rejection within three months.	933	f	25. ANSWER: The most correct answer is (D). See 35 U.S.C. § 154(b); 37 CFR § 1.702(f); MPEP § 2730 (quoting section 1.702(f)). The application was filed prior to May 29, 2000 and is ineligible for the provisions of Patent Term Adjustment (PTA). Moreover, the filing of a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) under 35 U.S.C. § 132(b) and 37 CFR § 1.114 does not cause an application filed before May 29, 2000 to be entitled to the benefits PTA under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 154(b) and 37 CFR §§ 1.702-1.705. See MPEP § 2730. (A) and (B) are not correct answers because the application was filed prior to May 29, 2000, the eligibility date for applications to receive the benefit of PTA provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 154(b) and 37 CFR §§ 1.702 through 705. Answer choice (C) is not correct because utility applications, not design applications are subject to the PTA provisions and the answer suggests that design applications are eligible for PTA. Answer choice (E) is not a correct answer because the application is not eligible for PTA and filing an RCE does not make an ineligible application eligible for PTA. Design patents are granted for fourteen year terms from the grant of the patent. 35 U.S.C. § 171. Utility patents are subject to patent term adjustment. 35 U.S.C. § 154(b)
10652	(B) The patentee would earn PTA because the Office failed to mail at least one\nnotification under 35 USC 132 or notice of allowance under 35 USC 151 no later\nthan fourteen months after the date the application was filed under 35 USC 111(a)\nand would not lose any earned PTA because applicant filed a response to the nonfinal\nrejection within three months.	933	f	25. ANSWER: The most correct answer is (D). See 35 U.S.C. § 154(b); 37 CFR § 1.702(f); MPEP § 2730 (quoting section 1.702(f)). The application was filed prior to May 29, 2000 and is ineligible for the provisions of Patent Term Adjustment (PTA).

(A) and (B) are not correct answers because the application was filed prior to May 29, 2000, the eligibility date for applications to receive the benefit of PTA provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 154(b) and 37 CFR §§ 1.702 through 705. Answer choice (C) is not correct because utility applications, not design applications are subject to the PTA provisions and the answer suggests that design applications are eligible for PTA. Answer choice (E) is not a correct answer because the application is not eligible for PTA and filing an RCE does not make an ineligible application eligible for PTA. Design patents are granted for fourteen year terms from the grant of the patent. 35 U.S.C. § 171. Utility patents are subject to patent term adjustment. 35 U.S.C. § 154(b)
10653	(C) The patentee would not earn any additional time under the provisions of PTA\nbecause the application is utility application, not a design application.	933	f	25. ANSWER: The most correct answer is (D). See 35 U.S.C. § 154(b); 37 CFR § 1.702(f); MPEP § 2730 (quoting section 1.702(f)). The application was filed prior to May 29, 2000 and is ineligible for the provisions of Patent Term Adjustment (PTA). Moreover, the filing of a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) under 35 U.S.C. § 132(b) and 37 CFR § 1.114 does not cause an application filed before May 29, 2000 to be entitled to the benefits PTA under the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 154(b) and 37 CFR §§ 1.702-1.705.

10693	(C) “the outer surface of the sphere being ...,” where the claim does not previously\nrecite that the sphere has an “outer surface.”	941	f	33. ANSWER: (D) is correct. "Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent basis in the recitation of the components themselves." MPEP § 2173.05(e). The MPEP provides an analogous example: "the limitation 'the outer surface of said sphere' would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere have an outer surface." Id. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all examples of things which inherently have the claimed characteristic and do not have an antecedent basis problem; that is, all circles have a center, all ellipses have a major diameter, all spheres have an outer surface, and all rectangles have an area, and these characteristics need not be provided with express antecedent basis. The ellipse example is from Bose Corp. v. JBL Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("There can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of an ellipse is a major diameter."). The lever recited in (D) is not an inherent component of a machine and therefore requires express antecedent basis. 
10654	(D) The patentee would not earn any additional time because the application was filed\nprior to May 29, 2000 and the filing of the RCE would not make the application\neligible for PTA.	933	t	25. ANSWER: The most correct answer is (D). See 35 U.S.C. § 154(b); 37 CFR § 1.702(f); MPEP § 2730 (quoting section 1.702(f)).

(A) and (B) are not correct answers because the application was filed prior to May 29, 2000, the eligibility date for applications to receive the benefit of PTA provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 154(b) and 37 CFR §§ 1.702 through 705. Answer choice (C) is not correct because utility applications, not design applications are subject to the PTA provisions and the answer suggests that design applications are eligible for PTA.

10655	(E) The patentee would earn PTA because the filing of the RCE on October 15, 2002\nmakes the application eligible for PTA and the Office did not mail at least one\nnotification under 35 USC or notice of allowance under 35 USC 151 within 14\nmonths of the date the application was filed under 35 USC 111(a).	933	f	25. ANSWER: The most correct answer is (D). See 35 U.S.C. § 154(b); 37 CFR § 1.702(f); MPEP § 2730 (quoting section 1.702(f)). The application was filed prior to May 29, 2000 and is ineligible for the provisions of Patent Term Adjustment (PTA).

10656	(A) When filed in a nonprovisional application after the Notice of Allowance has been\nmailed.	934	f	26. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 714.16, third paragraph, states “a supplemental reissue oath or declaration is treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312 because the correction of the patent which it provides is an amendment of the patent, even though no amendment is physically entered into the specification or claim(s).” Answer (A) is incorrect because a supplemental oath or declaration is not treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312 except when submitted in a reissue. See MPEP § 603.01. Answer (B) is incorrect because a supplemental oath or declaration in a reissue will be treated as an amendment under 37 CFR § 1.312 only if filed after allowance. Answer (C) is incorrect because amendments filed after the date the issue fee has been paid are no longer permitted under 37 CFR § 1.312. (E) is wrong because (A) is correct.

ANSWER:  (D).   37  C.F.R.  §  1.116;  MPEP  §  714.13,  Entry  Not  Matter  of  Right  [p.  700-118].    The  reply  in  (D)  is  directed  to  a  reply  permitted  to  be  made  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.116(a).    (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  directed  to  the  merits  of  the  application,  and  are  not  in  accord  with  37  C.F.R. § 1.116(a).
10666	(A) No, because Patent A suggests circular receptacles for any complementary bottle,\nalbeit for a different purpose.	936	t	28. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s Is Permissible.”  Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular  and  which  can  be  shaped  to  complement  the  shape  of  the  object  to  be  received.  The purpose for this in Patent A is to keep the cart organized, not as in the claim to prevent the object from falling and breaking. The difference in objectives does not defeat the case for obviousness because,  as  MPEP  §  2144  states,  the  “reason  or  motivation  to  modify  the  reference  may  often  suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different problem. It is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve the same advantage or result discovered  by  applicant.  In  re  Linter,  458  F.2d  1013,  173  USPQ  560  (CCPA  1972)  ...;  In  re  Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 904 (1991) ... .” In  other  words,  it  does  not  matter  that  Patent  A  does  not  appreciate  the  claimed  purpose  of  preventing  breakage.  It  suggests  an  insert  with  receptacles  to  hold  bottles.  That  is  enough  to  render  the  claimed  subject  matter  prima  facie  obvious.  The  prima  facie  case  is  not  rebutted  by  arguing  that  the  purpose  for  the  claimed  insert  is  different  form  that  specified  for  the  insert  described  in  Patent  A.  That  is  why  answer  (C)  is  wrong.  To  rebut  the  prima  facie  case,  the  practitioner must show a difference in structure instead. Answer (B) is wrong because the prima facie  case  is  not  rebutted  by  showing  that  Patent  A  does  not  teach  wine  bottles.  This  is  not  an  anticipation  rejection  where  identity  of  subject  matter  might  be  an  issue.  This  is  a  question  of  obviousness.  Therefore,  it  is  sufficient  to  point  out  that  Patent  A  is  a  generic  teaching  of  shopping cart inserts that hold objects of any size and shape. (D) is not the most correct answer because  what  Patent  A  is  interested  in  doing  is  irrelevant  to  the  question  of  obviousness.  (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  it  was  not  the  practitioner’s  argument.  However,  the  question  inquires  about  the  merits  of  the  argument  that  the  practitioner  made  as  set  forth  in  the  penultimate sentence of the question, not the merits of some hypothetical reply the examiner may communicate. 
10667	(B) Yes, because there is no suggestion in Patent A that the plastic insert can hold a\nwine bottle.	936	f	28. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s Is Permissible.”  Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular  and  which  can  be  shaped  to  complement  the  shape  of  the  object  to  be  received.

10668	(C) Yes, because the claim uses the insert to keep the bottles from falling and\nbreaking while Patent A uses the insert to keep the cart organized.	936	f	28. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s Is Permissible.”  Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular  and  which  can  be  shaped  to  complement  the  shape  of  the  object  to  be  received.

10669	(D) Yes, because Patent A is more interested in organizing boxes than holding bottles.	936	f	28. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s Is Permissible.”  Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular  and  which  can  be  shaped  to  complement  the  shape  of  the  object  to  be  received.

11055	(E)after a supplemental examiner’s answer, pursuant to a remand from the Board ofPatent Appeals and Interferences has been mailed.	1013	f	5.     ANSWER:  (C)  is  most  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181;  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    (A)  and  (B)  are  wrong.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.181(a)(1);  MPEP  §  706.07(c).    Prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  is  not  appealable.    37  C.F.R.  §    1.191(a).    (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(c)  states, “Any  question  as  to    prematureness  of  a  final  rejection  should  be  raised,  if  at  all,  while  the  application  is  still  pending  before  the  primary  examiner.”    MPEP  §  1210  indicates  that  jurisdiction is before the Board at the times set forth in (D) and (E). 
11646	(C) An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by a third-party declaration stating only that the products are different.	1132	f	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer. The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual. Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C). (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B). (E) is not the most correct answer. Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).
10670	(E) Yes, because the prevention from breakage is an unexpected property of the\nplastic insert.	936	f	28. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale Different From Applicant’s Is Permissible.”  Patent A suggests an insert with receptacles that are circular  and  which  can  be  shaped  to  complement  the  shape  of  the  object  to  be  received.  The purpose for this in Patent A is to keep the cart organized, not as in the claim to prevent the object from falling and breaking. The difference in objectives does not defeat the case for obviousness because,  as  MPEP  §  2144  states,  the  “reason  or  motivation  to  modify  the  reference  may  often  suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different problem. It is not necessary that the prior art suggest the combination to achieve the same advantage or result discovered  by  applicant.  In  re  Linter,  458  F.2d  1013,  173  USPQ  560  (CCPA  1972)  ...;  In  re  Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 904 (1991) ... .” In  other  words,  it  does  not  matter  that  Patent  A  does  not  appreciate  the  claimed  purpose  of  preventing  breakage.  It  suggests  an  insert  with  receptacles  to  hold  bottles.  That  is  enough  to  render  the  claimed  subject  matter  prima  facie  obvious.  The  prima  facie  case  is  not  rebutted  by  arguing  that  the  purpose  for  the  claimed  insert  is  different  form  that  specified  for  the  insert  described  in  Patent  A.  That  is  why  answer  (C)  is  wrong.  To  rebut  the  prima  facie  case,  the  practitioner must show a difference in structure instead. Answer (B) is wrong because the prima facie  case  is  not  rebutted  by  showing  that  Patent  A  does  not  teach  wine  bottles.  This  is  not  an  anticipation  rejection  where  identity  of  subject  matter  might  be  an  issue.  This  is  a  question  of  obviousness.  Therefore,  it  is  sufficient  to  point  out  that  Patent  A  is  a  generic  teaching  of  shopping cart inserts that hold objects of any size and shape. (D) is not the most correct answer because  what  Patent  A  is  interested  in  doing  is  irrelevant  to  the  question  of  obviousness.  (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  it  was  not  the  practitioner’s  argument.  However,  the  question  inquires  about  the  merits  of  the  argument  that  the  practitioner  made  as  set  forth  in  the  penultimate sentence of the question, not the merits of some hypothetical reply the examiner may communicate. 
10671	(A) A doctoral thesis indexed and shelved in a library can be sufficiently accessible to\nthe public to constitute prior art as a printed publication.	937	f	29.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  proper  answer.    MPEP  §  2128.02,  under  the  heading  “Date  of  Accessibility  Can  Be  Shown  Through  Evidence  of  Routine  Business  Practices,”  states,  in  reliance upon Constant v. Advanced Micro-Devices, Inc., 848 F.2d 1560, 7 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir.), cert. denied, 988 U.S. 892 (1988), and In re Hall, 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986), “Evidence showing routine business practices can be used to establish the date on which publication  became  accessible  to  the  public.    Specific  evidence  showing  when  the  specific  document actually became available is not always necessary.”  Answer (A) is incorrect.  MPEP §  2128.01,  under  the  heading  “A  Thesis  Placed  In  A  University  Library  May  Be  Prior  Art  If  Sufficiently  Accessible  To  The  Public,”  states  “[a]  doctoral  thesis  indexed  and  shelved  in  a  library is sufficiently accessible to the public to constitute prior art as a ‘printed publication.’  In re Hall, 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986).  Even if access to the library is restricted, a  reference  will  constitute  a  ‘printed  publication’  as  long  as  a  presumption  is  raised  that  the  portion of the public concerned with the art would know of the invention.  In re Bayer, 568 F.2d 1357,  196  USPQ  670  (CCPA  1978).”    Answer  (C)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2128.01,  under  the  heading  “Orally  Presented  Paper  Can  Constitute  A  ‘Printed  Publication’  If  Written  Copies  Are  Available Without Restriction,” states, in reliance upon Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. AB Fortia, 774 F.2d 1104, 1109, 227 USPQ 428, 432 (Fed. Cir. 1985): “[a] paper which is orally presented  in  a  forum  open  to  all  interested  persons  constitutes  a  ‘printed  publication’  if  written  copies are disseminated without restriction.”  Answer (D) is incorrect.

Cir.  1990).  “[d]ocuments  and items only distributed internally within an organization which are intended to remain confidential are  not  ‘printed  publications’  no  matter  how  many  copies  are  distributed.”    Answer  (E)  is  incorrect.  MPEP § 2128.02, under the heading “A Journal Article or Other Publication Becomes Available As Prior Art on Date of It Is Received by a Member of the Public,” states, in reliance upon In re Schlittler, 234 F.2d 882, 110 USPQ 304 (CCPA 1956): “[a] publication disseminated by mail is not prior art until it is received by at least one member of the public.” 
10672	(B) Evidence showing routine business practices is never sufficient to establish the\ndate on which a publication became accessible to the public.	937	t	29.

10673	(C) A paper which is orally presented in a forum open to all interested persons can\nconstitute a “printed publication” if written copies are disseminated without\nrestriction.	937	f	29.

10681	(A) Claim 5. A hydrocyclone separator apparatus according to claim 4, wherein said\nblades are configured in the form of generally plane surfaces curved in one plane\nonly.	939	f	31. ANSWER: (C). 35 U.S.C. § 305; MPEP §§ 2258 and 1412.03. MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Claims In Proceeding Must Not Enlarge Scope Of The Claims Of The Patent,” states “[w]here new or amended claims are presented . . . the claims of the reexamination proceeding should be examined under 35 U.S.C. 305, to determine whether they enlarge the scope of the original claims. 35 U.S.C. 305 states that ‘no proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of the claims of the patent will be permitted in a reexamination proceeding...’." Under the further subheading “Criteria for Enlargement of the Scope of the Claims,” MPEP § 2258 states “A claim presented in a reexamination proceeding ‘enlarges the scope’ of the claims of the patent being reexamined where the claim is broader than each and every claim of the patent. See MPEP § 1412.03 for guidance as to when the presented claim is considered to be a broadening claim as compared with the claims of the patent, i.e., what is broadening and what is not. If a claim is considered to be a broadening claim for purposes of reissue, it is likewise considered to be a broadening claim in reexamination.” MPEP § 1412.03, under the heading “New Category of Invention Added In Reissue – Broadening,” states “[t]he addition of process claims as a new category of invention to be claimed in the patent (i.e., where there were no method claims present in the original patent) is generally considered as being a broadening of the invention. See Ex parte Wikdahl, 10 USPQ2d 1546, 1549 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).” MPEP 2258, under the further subheading “Rejection of Claims Where There Is Enlargement,” states “[a]ny claim in a reexamination proceeding which enlarges the scope of the claims of the patent should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 305.” Since no claims drawn to a method were ever presented during prosecution of Patent X (claims 1 through 4 “are the only claims that were ever presented during prosecution of the application that matured into Patent X”), the claim recited in (C) is not directed to “the invention as claimed.” (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect because each of their claims are directed to a hydrocyclone separator apparatus, i.e., “the invention as claimed,” and they do not enlarge the scope of the claims in Patent X. (E) is an incorrect answer because (C) is the correct answer. 
10694	(D) “the lever of the machine being located ...,” where the claim does not previously\nrecite a “lever.”	941	t	33. ANSWER: (D) is correct. "Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent basis in the recitation of the components themselves." MPEP § 2173.05(e). The MPEP provides an analogous example: "the limitation 'the outer surface of said sphere' would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere have an outer surface." Id. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all examples of things which inherently have the claimed characteristic and do not have an antecedent basis problem; that is, all circles have a center, all ellipses have a major diameter, all spheres have an outer surface, and all rectangles have an area, and these characteristics need not be provided with express antecedent basis. The ellipse example is from Bose Corp. v. JBL Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("There can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of an ellipse is a major diameter."). The lever recited in (D) is not an inherent component of a machine and therefore requires express antecedent basis. 
10682	(B) Claim 5. A hydrocyclone separator apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the\noutlet duct is in the form of two frustro-conical portions joined at their narrow\nends.	939	f	31. ANSWER: (C). 35 U.S.C. § 305; MPEP §§ 2258 and 1412.03. MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Claims In Proceeding Must Not Enlarge Scope Of The Claims Of The Patent,” states “[w]here new or amended claims are presented . . . the claims of the reexamination proceeding should be examined under 35 U.S.C. 305, to determine whether they enlarge the scope of the original claims. 35 U.S.C. 305 states that ‘no proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of the claims of the patent will be permitted in a reexamination proceeding...’."

(E) is an incorrect answer because (C) is the correct answer. 
10683	(C) Claim 5. A method of separating material including fibers suspended in a liquid\nsuspension comprising the steps of separating the material into a light fraction\ncontaining the fibers and a heavy fraction containing rejects, and converting the\nlight fraction into a pulp and paper stock suspension.	939	t	31. ANSWER: (C). 35 U.S.C. § 305; MPEP §§ 2258 and 1412.03. MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Claims In Proceeding Must Not Enlarge Scope Of The Claims Of The Patent,” states “[w]here new or amended claims are presented . . . the claims of the reexamination proceeding should be examined under 35 U.S.C. 305, to determine whether they enlarge the scope of the original claims. 35 U.S.C. 305 states that ‘no proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of the claims of the patent will be permitted in a reexamination proceeding...’."

(E) is an incorrect answer because (C) is the correct answer. 
10684	(D) Claim 5. A hydrocyclone separator apparatus according to claim 4, wherein the\nseparator chamber is conical in shape having at the narrow end an outlet for the\nheavy fraction and at its wide end an outlet for the light fraction.	939	f	31. ANSWER: (C). 35 U.S.C. § 305; MPEP §§ 2258 and 1412.03. MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Claims In Proceeding Must Not Enlarge Scope Of The Claims Of The Patent,” states “[w]here new or amended claims are presented . . . the claims of the reexamination proceeding should be examined under 35 U.S.C. 305, to determine whether they enlarge the scope of the original claims. 35 U.S.C. 305 states that ‘no proposed amended or new claim enlarging the scope of the claims of the patent will be permitted in a reexamination proceeding...’."

(E) is an incorrect answer because (C) is the correct answer. 
10685	(E) None of the above.	939	f	31. ANSWER: (C). 35 U.S.C. § 305; MPEP §§ 2258 and 1412.03.

If a claim is considered to be a broadening claim for purposes of reissue, it is likewise considered to be a broadening claim in reexamination.” MPEP § 1412.03, under the heading “New Category of Invention Added In Reissue – Broadening,” states “[t]he addition of process claims as a new category of invention to be claimed in the patent (i.e., where there were no method claims present in the original patent) is generally considered as being a broadening of the invention. See Ex parte Wikdahl, 10 USPQ2d 1546, 1549 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989).” MPEP 2258, under the further subheading “Rejection of Claims Where There Is Enlargement,” states “[a]ny claim in a reexamination proceeding which enlarges the scope of the claims of the patent should be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 305.” Since no claims drawn to a method were ever presented during prosecution of Patent X (claims 1 through 4 “are the only claims that were ever presented during prosecution of the application that matured into Patent X”), the claim recited in (C) is not directed to “the invention as claimed.” (A), (B), and (D) are all incorrect because each of their claims are directed to a hydrocyclone separator apparatus, i.e., “the invention as claimed,” and they do not enlarge the scope of the claims in Patent X. (E) is an incorrect answer because (C) is the correct answer. 
10686	(A) Statement (1) only	940	f	32. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct, as only statement (2) is true. The examiner has the initial burden to establish a reasonable basis to question the enablement provided. MPEP § 2164.04 states “[i]n order to make a rejection, the examiner has the initial burden to establish a reasonable basis to question the enablement provided for the claimed invention. In re Wright, 999 F.2d 1557, 1562, 27 USPQ2d 1510, 1513 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (examiner must provide a reasonable explanation as to why the scope of protection provided by a claim is not adequately enabled by the disclosure).” Answer (A) is incorrect, because statement (1) is not true. The examiner may not analyze enablement before construing the claims. MPEP § 2164.04. Answer (C) is incorrect, because statement (3) is not true. The examiner must give reasons for the uncertainty of the enablement, even when there is no evidence of operability without undue experimentation other than the disclosed embodiments. In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 1566, 34 USPQ2d 1436, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 1995).

10691	(A) “the center of the circle having ...,” where the claim does not previously recite that\nthe circle has a “center.”	941	f	33. ANSWER: (D) is correct. "Inherent components of elements recited have antecedent basis in the recitation of the components themselves." MPEP § 2173.05(e). The MPEP provides an analogous example: "the limitation 'the outer surface of said sphere' would not require an antecedent recitation that the sphere have an outer surface." Id. (A), (B), (C), and (E) are all examples of things which inherently have the claimed characteristic and do not have an antecedent basis problem; that is, all circles have a center, all ellipses have a major diameter, all spheres have an outer surface, and all rectangles have an area, and these characteristics need not be provided with express antecedent basis. The ellipse example is from Bose Corp. v. JBL Inc., 61 USPQ2d 1216, 1219 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("There can be no dispute that mathematically an inherent characteristic of an ellipse is a major diameter."). The lever recited in (D) is not an inherent component of a machine and therefore requires express antecedent basis. 
11056	(A)A rejection properly based on statutory double patenting. 	1014	f	6.     ANSWER:  (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  715.    (A)  is  incorrect  because  an  affidavit  under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where the reference is a prior U.S. patent to the same entity,  claiming  the  same  invention.  MPEP  §  715.    (B)  and  (D)  are  each  incorrect  because  an  affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where the reference is a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(d) as in (B) or a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as in (D).  MPEP § 715.  (C) is incorrect because an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where applicant has clearly admitted on the record that subject matter relied on in the reference is prior art. MPEP § 715. 
11647	(D)An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F.	1132	f	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer. The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual. Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C). (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B). (E) is not the most correct answer. Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).

Under  37  CFR  §  1.313(c)(2),  a  petition  to  withdraw  the  application  from  issue  can  be  filed  after  payment  of  the  issue  fee  to  permit  consideration  of  a  Request  for  Continued  Examination (RCE) under 37 CFR § 1.114.  See also MPEP § 1308.
10700	(E) After paying the issue fee, timely file a petition to withdraw the application from\nissue to permit consideration of a Request for Continued Examination (RCE)\nunder 37 CFR 1.114, the fee for filing an RCE, and an IDS citing the reference.	942	f	34. ANSWER:   (A), describing a procedure that is not in accordance with the USPTO rules and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP  ,  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  609,  under  the  heading   “Minimum   Requirements   for   an   Information   Disclosure   Statement,”   under   the   subheading  “B(3).  Information  Disclosure  Statement  Filed  After  B(2),  but  Prior  to  Payment  of  Issue Fee 37 CFR 1.97 (d)”, and subheading “B(5) Statement Under 37 CFR 1.97(e).”  (A) The statement  specified  in  37  CFR  §  1.97(e)  requires  that  the  practitioner  certify,  after  reasonable  inquiry,  that  no  item  of  information  contained  in  the  IDS  was  known  to  any  individual  designated  in  37  CFR  §  1.56(c)  more  than  three  months  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  information  disclosure statement.  The practitioner cannot certify this because the reference was known to the client before February 11, 2002, the time of filing of the utility application, which was more than three  months  prior  to  the  filing  of  the  information  disclosure  statement.    See  (B),  stating  a  procedure that conforms with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP, is an incorrect answer.  Under 37 CFR § 1.313(a), a petition to withdraw the application from issue is not  required  if  a  proper  RCE  is  filed  before  payment  of  the  issue  fee.    (C),  stating  a  procedure  that  conforms  with  the  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  is  an  incorrect  answer.  A practitioner can file a continuing application on or before the date that the issue fee is due and permit the parent application to become abandoned for failure to pay the issue fee.  (D), stating  a  procedure  that  conforms  with  the  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  is  an  incorrect  answer.    Under  37  CFR  §  1.313(c)(3),  a  petition  to  withdraw  the  application  from  issue  can  be  filed  after  payment  of  the  issue  fee  to  permit  the  express  abandonment of the application in favor of a continuing application.  (E), stating a procedure that conforms  with  the  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  is  an  incorrect  answer.    Under  37  CFR  §  1.313(c)(2),  a  petition  to  withdraw  the  application  from  issue  can  be  filed  after  payment  of  the  issue  fee  to  permit  consideration  of  a  Request  for  Continued  Examination (RCE) under 37 CFR § 1.114.  See also MPEP § 1308.
11122	(B)A  change  of  purpose  after  the  payment  of  a  fee,  such  as  when  a  party  desires  to  withdraw  a  patent  filing  for  which  the  fee  was  paid,  including  an  application,  an  appeal or a request for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. 	1027	f	19.  ANSWER:  (A)  is  the  best  answer  as  there  is  no  provision  regarding  one  year  from  discovery  in  37  C.F.R.  §  1.26.    As  to  (B)  through  (E)  see  MPEP  §  607.02.    The  Office  will  refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less if requested to do so by the applicant.  See MPEP § 607.02 at p. 600-51.  As to (A), (B), (D) and (E), see MPEP § 607.02 at p. 600-51.
10701	(A) The original specification would enable one of ordinary skill in the art to practice\nthe invention as now claimed.	943	f	35.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer  because  (B)  and  (C)  together  are  correct.    Regarding  (B),  see  MPEP  §  2163.02,  which  states,  “Whenever  the  [written  description]  issue  arises,  the  fundamental  factual  inquiry  is  whether  the  specification  conveys  with  reasonable  clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed. See, e.g., Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d  1111,  1117  (Fed.  Cir.  1991).  An  applicant  shows  possession  of  the  claimed  invention  by  describing  the  claimed  invention  with  all  of  its  limitations  using  such  descriptive  means  as  words,  structures,  figures,  diagrams,  and  formulas  that  fully  set  forth  the  claimed  invention.  Lockwood  v.  American  Airlines,  Inc.,  107  F.3d  1565,  1572,  41  USPQ2d  1961,  1966  (Fed.  Cir.  1997).”    Regarding  (C),  see  MPEP  §  2163.02,  which  states,  “The  courts  have  described  the  essential  question  to  be  addressed  in  a  description  requirement  issue  in  a  variety  of  ways.  An  objective standard for determining compliance with the written description requirement is, ‘does the  description  clearly  allow  persons  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art  to  recognize  that  he  or  she  invented what is claimed.’ In reGosteli, 872 F.2d 1008, 1012, 10 USPQ2d 1614, 1618 (Fed. Cir. 1989).  Under  Vas-Cath,  Inc.v.Mahurkar,  935  F.2d  1555,  1563-64,  19  USPQ2d  1111,  1117  (Fed.  Cir.  1991),  to  satisfy  the  written  description  requirement,  an  applicant  must  convey  with  reasonable  clarity  to  those  skilled  in  the  art  that,  as  of  the  filing  date  sought,  he  or  she  was  in  possession of the invention, and that the invention, in that context, is whatever is now claimed.”  (B)  alone  and  (C)  alone  are  incorrect  inasmuch  as  they  do  not  address  each  of  the  examiner’s  rationales for the rejection.  (A) is incorrect. MPEP § 2161. The written description requirement is separate and distinct from the enablement requirement of 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph. The argument does not address and otherwise traverse the rejection that was made.   (D) is incorrect.  MPEP   §   2163.03,   under   the   headings   “RELIANCE   ON   FILING   DATE   OF   PARENT   APPLICATION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 120,” and “RELIANCE ON PRIORITY UNDER 35 U.S.C. 119.”  The  related  case  must  be  an  application  having  a  filing  date  to  which  the  instant  application is entitled, e.g., a parent or provisional application.  The argument does not show the instant  application  is  related  to  the  “related  application”  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  119  or  120.    (B)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (C)  is  also  correct.    (C)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (B)  is  also  correct.
10702	(B) Literal support for new claim language is not required.	943	f	35.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer  because  (B)  and  (C)  together  are  correct.    Regarding  (B),  see  MPEP  §  2163.02,  which  states,  “Whenever  the  [written  description]  issue  arises,  the  fundamental  factual  inquiry  is  whether  the  specification  conveys  with  reasonable  clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed.

The argument does not show the instant  application  is  related  to  the  “related  application”  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  119  or  120.    (B)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (C)  is  also  correct.    (C)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (B)  is  also  correct.
10703	(C) The original specification reasonably conveys to one of ordinary skill in the art\nthat the inventor had the claimed invention in his/her possession as of the filing\ndate of the application.	943	f	35.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer  because  (B)  and  (C)  together  are  correct.

The argument does not show the instant  application  is  related  to  the  “related  application”  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  119  or  120.    (B)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (C)  is  also  correct.    (C)  alone  is  not  correct  because  (B)  is  also  correct.
10706	(A) The application is abandoned.	944	f	36. ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer. See MPEP §§ 706.07(h), under the heading “X. After Appeal But Before Decision By Board,” and 1215.01. As explained in MPEP § 1215.01, “The filing of an RCE will be treated as a withdrawal of the appeal by the applicant, regardless of whether the RCE includes the appropriate fee or a submission.” Thus, the filing of the RCE without the fee results in the withdrawal of the appeal in this application and passage of the application to issue with the allowed claims 6-10 after the cancellation of both rejected claims 1- 3 and claims 4 and 5 which are allowable except for their dependency from rejected claim 1  (A) is incorrect.  As also explained in MPEP § 1215.01, although an application under appeal having no  allowed  claims  will  be  considered  abandoned  by  the  filing  of  an  improper  RCE,  an  application  having  allowed  claims  will  be  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    Upon  withdrawal  of  appeal,  claims  which  are  allowable  except  for  their  dependency  from  rejected  claims will be treated as if they were rejected.  See MPEP § 1215.01.  All rejected claims, such as claims 1-3, and claims which are allowable except for their dependency from rejected claims, such as claims 4 and 5, will be canceled.  (B) is incorrect.  As explained in MPEP § 706.07(h), under  the  heading  “After  Appeal  But  Before  Decision  By  The  Board,”  proceedings  as  to  the  rejected  claims  are  terminated  and  the  application  is  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    MPEP § 1215.01 explains that the filing of an RCE will be treated as a withdrawal of the appeal by  the  applicant,  regardless  of  whether  the  RCE  includes  the  appropriate  fee  or  a  submission.    (C) is incorrect for the reasons explained for (A), and because claims 4 and 5 will be canceled.  (E) is incorrect.  The RCE, which was filed without the fee, is improper.  Thus, as explained in MPEP  §  706.07(h),.  under  the  heading,  “After  Appeal  But  Before  Decision  By  The  Board,”    proceedings  as  to  the  rejected  claims  are  terminated  and  the  application  is  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    MPEP  §  1215.01  explains  that  the  filing  of  an  RCE  will  be  treated  as  a  withdrawal  of  the  appeal  by  the  applicant,  regardless  of  whether  the  RCE  includes  the  appropriate fee or a submission. 
10707	(B) The application is still pending and under appeal awaiting a decision by the Board\nof Patent Appeals and Interferences, because the RCE was improper.	944	f	36. ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer. See MPEP §§ 706.07(h), under the heading “X. After Appeal But Before Decision By Board,” and 1215.01. As explained in MPEP § 1215.01, “The filing of an RCE will be treated as a withdrawal of the appeal by the applicant, regardless of whether the RCE includes the appropriate fee or a submission.” Thus, the filing of the RCE without the fee results in the withdrawal of the appeal in this application and passage of the application to issue with the allowed claims 6-10 after the cancellation of both rejected claims 1- 3 and claims 4 and 5 which are allowable except for their dependency from rejected claim 1  (A) is incorrect.  As also explained in MPEP § 1215.01, although an application under appeal having no  allowed  claims  will  be  considered  abandoned  by  the  filing  of  an  improper  RCE,  an  application  having  allowed  claims  will  be  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    Upon  withdrawal  of  appeal,  claims  which  are  allowable  except  for  their  dependency  from  rejected  claims will be treated as if they were rejected.  See MPEP § 1215.01.  All rejected claims, such as claims 1-3, and claims which are allowable except for their dependency from rejected claims, such as claims 4 and 5, will be canceled.  (B) is incorrect.  As explained in MPEP § 706.07(h), under  the  heading  “After  Appeal  But  Before  Decision  By  The  Board,”  proceedings  as  to  the  rejected  claims  are  terminated  and  the  application  is  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    MPEP § 1215.01 explains that the filing of an RCE will be treated as a withdrawal of the appeal by  the  applicant,  regardless  of  whether  the  RCE  includes  the  appropriate  fee  or  a  submission.    (C) is incorrect for the reasons explained for (A), and because claims 4 and 5 will be canceled.  (E) is incorrect.  The RCE, which was filed without the fee, is improper.  Thus, as explained in MPEP  §  706.07(h),.  under  the  heading,  “After  Appeal  But  Before  Decision  By  The  Board,”    proceedings  as  to  the  rejected  claims  are  terminated  and  the  application  is  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.    MPEP  §  1215.01  explains  that  the  filing  of  an  RCE  will  be  treated  as  a  withdrawal  of  the  appeal  by  the  applicant,  regardless  of  whether  the  RCE  includes  the  appropriate fee or a submission. 
10708	(C) The application is still pending; the appeal is considered withdrawn and the\napplication will be passed to issue with claims 1-3 canceled and claims 4-10\nallowed.	944	f	36.

(C) is incorrect for the reasons explained for (A), and because claims 4 and 5 will be canceled.  (E) is incorrect.  The RCE, which was filed without the fee, is improper.  Thus, as explained in MPEP  §  706.07(h),.  under  the  heading,  “After  Appeal  But  Before  Decision  By  The  Board,”    proceedings  as  to  the  rejected  claims  are  terminated  and  the  application  is  passed  to  issue  with  the  allowed  claims.

10710	(E) The appeal is withdrawn; the application is returned to the primary examiner and\nprosecution is reopened as to claims 1-10.	944	f	36. ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer. See MPEP §§ 706.07(h), under the heading “X. After Appeal But Before Decision By Board,” and 1215.01.

10711	(A) Argue that the patent teaches away from the use of a diamond grit particle coating\non a polishing wheel and thus does not teach the claimed invention.	945	f	37.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  37  CFR  §  1.111(b);  MPEP  §§ 706.02(b), 2131 and 2131.03.  As stated in MPEP 2131, under the heading “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim,” “A claim is anticipated only if each  and  every  element  as  set  forth  in  the  claim  is  found,  either  expressly  or  inherently  described, in a single prior art reference.”  Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d  628,  631,  2  USPQ2d  1051,  1053  (Fed.  Cir.  1987).    MPEP  2131.03,  under  the  heading,  “Prior  Art  Which  Teaches  A  Range  Within,  Overlapping,  Or  Touching  The  Claimed  Range  Anticipates If The Prior Art Range Discloses The Claimed Range With ‘Sufficient Specificity.’” states  “When  the  prior  art  discloses  a  range  which  touches,  overlaps  or  is  within  the  claimed  range,  but  no  specific  examples  falling  within  the  claimed  range  are  disclosed,  a  case  by  case  determination  must  be  made  as  to  anticipation.  In  order  to  anticipate  the  claims,  the  claimed  subject  matter  must  be  disclosed  in  the  reference  with  ‘sufficient  specificity  to  constitute  an  anticipation under the statute.’”  A claim containing a limitation that the grit particle size is 5-7 microns  would  not  be  anticipated  by  the  applied  reference,  because  the  applied  reference  discloses a different grit particle size well outside that range.  (A) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2123(8thEd.).    Patents  are  relevant  as  prior  art  for  all  they  contain  and  are  not  limited  to  their  preferred  embodiments.  See In re Heck, 699 F.2d 1331, 1332-33, 216 USPQ 1038, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and Merck  &  Co.  v.  Biocraft  Laboratories,  874  F.2d  804,  10  USPQ2d  1843  (Fed.

Evidence  of  secondary  considerations  such  as  unexpected  results  is  irrelevant  to  35  U.S.C.  §  102  rejections  and thus cannot overcome a rejection so based.  See In re Wiggins, 488 F.2d 538, 543,179 USPQ 421, 425 (CCPA 1973).  (C) is incorrect.  See MPEP § 715, under the heading “Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits or Declarations Are Inappropriate.”  An affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR § 1.131 is inappropriate where the reference publication date is more than 1 year prior to applicant’s effective filing date.  Such a reference is a “statutory bar” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as referenced in 37 CFR § 1.131(a)(2).  (D) is also incorrect.  See MPEP § 2131.05.  Argumentsthat  the  alleged  anticipatory  prior  art  is  “nonanalogous  art”  are  not  “germane”  to  a  rejection  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102.    Twin  Disc,  Inc.  v.

10731	(A) Claim 5. A gadget according to claims 1-3, in which …	949	f	41. ANSWER: The correct answer is (E). MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording.” Multiple dependent claims in proper form depend on preceding claims and refer to the claims from which they depend in the alternative only. Answer (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording,” and subheading “1. Claim Does Not Refer Back In the Alternative Only,” second example. A proper multiple dependent claim must refer back in the alternative only. Answer (B) is incorrect. See MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording,” and subheading “1. Claim Does Not Refer Back In the Alternative Only,” fifth example. A proper multiple dependent claim refers back in the alternative only. Answer (C) is incorrect. Answer (C) reproduces the example in MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording,” and subheading “3. References to Two Sets of Claims to Different Features.” A proper multiple dependent claim refers in the alternative to only one set of claims. Answer (D) is incorrect.

11648	(E)An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F because the claimed mixture Y has a melting point of 150° F and the mixture Y of patent A has a melting point of 300° F.	1132	f	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer. The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual. Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C). (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B). (E) is not the most correct answer. Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).

Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording.” Multiple dependent claims in proper form depend on preceding claims and refer to the claims from which they depend in the alternative only. Answer (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording,” and subheading “1.

10735	(E) None of the above are proper multiple dependent claims.	949	t	41. ANSWER: The correct answer is (E). MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording.” Multiple dependent claims in proper form depend on preceding claims and refer to the claims from which they depend in the alternative only. Answer (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “B. Unacceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording,” and subheading “1.

10736	(A) Yes. An immediate appeal to the Board can be filed to review the restriction\nrequirement if any claims have been twice rejected.	950	f	42. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1002.02(c) identifies among the matters petitionable to and decided by the Technology Center Directors “Petitions from a final decision of examiner requiring restriction in patent applications, 37 CFR 1.144, MPEP § 818.03(c).” Hence (A), and (C), which provide for review before the Board of Patent Appeals and  Interferences  are  clearly  erroneous.    Since  the  restriction  requirement  is  not  yet  “final”  no  review is possible at this juncture.  Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) are also incorrect because no claim  is  under  rejection  hence  no  appeal  is  possible.    See  MPEP  §  1205,  which  provides  that  under  37  CFR  1.191(a),  an  applicant  for  a  patent  dissatisfied  with  the  primary  examiner’s  decision in the second or final rejection of his or her claims may appeal to the Board for review of the examiner’s rejection by filing a notice of appeal and the required fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(b) within the time period provided under 37 CFR 1.134.and 1.136.  A notice of appeal may be  filed  after  any  of  the  claims  has  been  twice  rejected,  regardless  of  whether  the  claim(s)  has/have been finally rejected. The limitation of “twice or finally...rejected” does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an  appeal  in  the  continuing  application,  even  if  the  claim  was  rejected  only  once  in  the  continuing application.
10741	(A) the further limitation changes the scope of the dependent claim from that of the\nclaim from which it depends.	951	f	43. ANSWER: The answer is (C). See 37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP 608.01(n). Rule 1.75(c) provides that “[o]ne or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application.” See also MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.” For answer (A), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.” For answer (B), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[a] dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph, simply because there is a question as to (1) the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.” For answers (D) and (E), see MPEP § 608.01 (n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” fifth paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim, although it might result in a requirement for restriction.” 
10737	(B) No. An immediate appeal cannot be filed to the Board because the new claims\ndirected to a method of using a widget have not been twice rejected.	950	f	42. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1002.02(c) identifies among the matters petitionable to and decided by the Technology Center Directors “Petitions from a final decision of examiner requiring restriction in patent applications, 37 CFR 1.144, MPEP § 818.03(c).” Hence (A), and (C), which provide for review before the Board of Patent Appeals and  Interferences  are  clearly  erroneous.    Since  the  restriction  requirement  is  not  yet  “final”  no  review is possible at this juncture.  Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) are also incorrect because no claim  is  under  rejection  hence  no  appeal  is  possible.

10738	(C) Yes. An immediate appeal can be filed for any claims that have been twice\nrejected because the Board can also review any second restriction requirement\nmade against the same claims.	950	f	42. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1002.02(c) identifies among the matters petitionable to and decided by the Technology Center Directors “Petitions from a final decision of examiner requiring restriction in patent applications, 37 CFR 1.144, MPEP § 818.03(c).” Hence (A), and (C), which provide for review before the Board of Patent Appeals and  Interferences  are  clearly  erroneous.    Since  the  restriction  requirement  is  not  yet  “final”  no  review is possible at this juncture.  Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) are also incorrect because no claim  is  under  rejection  hence  no  appeal  is  possible.    See  MPEP  §  1205,  which  provides  that  under  37  CFR  1.191(a),  an  applicant  for  a  patent  dissatisfied  with  the  primary  examiner’s  decision in the second or final rejection of his or her claims may appeal to the Board for review of the examiner’s rejection by filing a notice of appeal and the required fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(b) within the time period provided under 37 CFR 1.134.and 1.136.  A notice of appeal may be  filed  after  any  of  the  claims  has  been  twice  rejected,  regardless  of  whether  the  claim(s)  has/have been finally rejected. The limitation of “twice or finally...rejected” does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an  appeal  in  the  continuing  application,  even  if  the  claim  was  rejected  only  once  in  the  continuing application.
10739	(D) No. An immediate appeal to the Board cannot be lodged because a provisional\nelection has not been made of either the claims to a widget or claims to a method\nof use of the widget.	950	f	42. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1002.02(c) identifies among the matters petitionable to and decided by the Technology Center Directors “Petitions from a final decision of examiner requiring restriction in patent applications, 37 CFR 1.144, MPEP § 818.03(c).” Hence (A), and (C), which provide for review before the Board of Patent Appeals and  Interferences  are  clearly  erroneous.    Since  the  restriction  requirement  is  not  yet  “final”  no  review is possible at this juncture.  Answers (A), (B), (C), and (D) are also incorrect because no claim  is  under  rejection  hence  no  appeal  is  possible.

The limitation of “twice or finally...rejected” does not have to be related to a particular application.  For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuing application, then applicant will be entitled to file an  appeal  in  the  continuing  application,  even  if  the  claim  was  rejected  only  once  in  the  continuing application.
10740	(E) No. An immediate appeal cannot be taken because no claims are currently under\nrejection. Review of a final restriction requirement is only possible as a\npetitionable matter before a Technology Center Director. It is not an appealable\nmatter to the Board.	950	t	42.

11124	(D)Any  refund  of  a  fee  paid  by  credit  card  will  be  by  a  credit  to  the  credit  card  account to which the fee was charged.	1027	f	19.  ANSWER:  (A)  is  the  best  answer  as  there  is  no  provision  regarding  one  year  from  discovery  in  37  C.F.R.  §  1.26.    As  to  (B)  through  (E)  see  MPEP  §  607.02.    The  Office  will  refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less if requested to do so by the applicant.  See MPEP § 607.02 at p. 600-51.  As to (A), (B), (D) and (E), see MPEP § 607.02 at p. 600-51.
10742	(B) the further limitation of the dependent claim is not significant.	951	f	43. ANSWER: The answer is (C). See 37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP 608.01(n). Rule 1.75(c) provides that “[o]ne or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application.” See also MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.” For answer (A), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.” For answer (B), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[a] dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph, simply because there is a question as to (1) the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.” For answers (D) and (E), see MPEP § 608.01 (n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” fifth paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim, although it might result in a requirement for restriction.” 
10743	(C) it does not refer back to and further limit the claim from which it depends.	951	t	43. ANSWER: The answer is (C). See 37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP 608.01(n). Rule 1.75(c) provides that “[o]ne or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application.” See also MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.” For answer (A), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.” For answer (B), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[a] dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph, simply because there is a question as to (1) the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.” For answers (D) and (E), see MPEP § 608.01 (n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” fifth paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim, although it might result in a requirement for restriction.” 
10744	(D) it relates to a separate invention.	951	f	43. ANSWER: The answer is (C). See 37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP 608.01(n). Rule 1.75(c) provides that “[o]ne or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application.” See also MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.” For answer (A), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.” For answer (B), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[a] dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph, simply because there is a question as to (1) the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.” For answers (D) and (E), see MPEP § 608.01 (n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” fifth paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim, although it might result in a requirement for restriction.” 
10745	(E) it is separately classified from the claim from which it depends.	951	f	43. ANSWER: The answer is (C). See 37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP 608.01(n). Rule 1.75(c) provides that “[o]ne or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application.” See also MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.” For answer (A), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.” For answer (B), see MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” second paragraph, wherein it states, “[a] dependent claim does not lack compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112, fourth paragraph, simply because there is a question as to (1) the significance of the further limitation added by the dependent claim.” For answers (D) and (E), see MPEP § 608.01 (n), under the heading “III Infringement Test,” fifth paragraph, wherein it states, “[t]he fact that a dependent claim which is otherwise proper might relate to a separate invention which would require a separate search or be separately classified from the claim on which it depends would not render it an improper dependent claim, although it might result in a requirement for restriction.”

Answers (B), (C) and (D)  are  incorrect  due  to  the  use  of  the  word  “only”.    Answer  (E)  does  not  include  the  term  “only”.  In addition, Answer (C) and (D) are also incorrect due to the inclusion of the phrase “as of  its  filing  date”.    As  set  forth  above,  “An  abandoned  patent  application  becomes  available  as  prior art only as of the date the public gains access to it.  See 37 CFR 1.14(e)(2).” 
10755	(E) may become prior art when it is properly incorporated by reference in the\ndisclosure of a U.S. application publication.	953	t	45.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    As  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  2127,  under  the  heading   “Abandoned   Applications,   Including   Provisional   Applications,”   and   subheading, “Abandoned Applications Disclosed to the Public Can Be Used as Prior Art,” states “the subject matter of an abandoned application, including both provisional and nonprovisional applications, referred  to  in  a  prior  art  U.S.  patent  may  be  relied  on  in  a  35  U.S.C.  102(e)  rejection  based  on  that patent if the disclosure of the abandoned application is actually included or incorporated by reference  in  the  patent.    Compare  In  re  Lund,  376  F.2d  982,  991,  153  USPQ  625,  633  (CCPA  1967)  (The  court  reversed  a  rejection  over  a  patent  which  was  a  continuation-in-part  of  an  abandoned  application.    Applicant’s  filing  date  preceded  the  issue  date  of  the  patent  reference.    The  abandoned  application  contained  subject  matter  which  was  essential  to  the  rejection  but  which was not carried over into the continuation-in-part.  The court held that the subject matter of  the  abandoned  application  was  not  available  to  the  public  as  of  either  the  parent’s  or  the  child’s  filing  dates  and  thus  could  not  be  relied  on  in  the  102(e)  rejection.).”  (A)  is  incorrect  since an abandoned patent application may become evidence of prior art.  Answers (B), (C) and (D)  are  incorrect  due  to  the  use  of  the  word  “only”.    Answer  (E)  does  not  include  the  term  “only”.  In addition, Answer (C) and (D) are also incorrect due to the inclusion of the phrase “as of  its  filing  date”.    As  set  forth  above,  “An  abandoned  patent  application  becomes  available  as  prior art only as of the date the public gains access to it.  See 37 CFR 1.14(e)(2).” 
10756	(A) A paper that was orally presented at a meeting held May 1, 2001, where the\nmeeting was open to all interested persons and the paper was distributed in\nwritten form to six people without restriction.	954	f	46. ANSWER: The correct answer is (C). The internal report was intended to be confidential and therefore is not a “printed publication” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). See MPEP § 2128.01, under the heading “Internal Documents Intended To Be Confidential Are Not ‘Printed Publications,” citing In re George, , 2 USPQ2d 1880 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1987) states “Research reports disseminated in-house to only those persons who understood the policy of confidentiality regarding such reports are not printed publications even though the policy was not specifically stated in writing.” Answer (A) is incorrect. An orally presented paper can be a “printed publication” if copies are available without restriction. The paper is a “printed publication” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). See MPEP § 2128.01. Answer (B) is incorrect. The thesis is a “printed publication” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b). See MPEP § 2128.01. Answer (D) is incorrect.

10761	(A) A claim is to be given its broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the\nsupporting disclosure in the specification.	955	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer. MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.” Answer (A) is an improper response to the question because it is a correct statement of claim interpretation during patent prosecution. As pointed out in MPEP § 2111.01, the court in In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting In re Okuzawa, 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)), states: “It is well settled that ‘claims are not to be read in a vacuum and limitations therein are to be interpreted in light of the specification in giving them their “broadest reasonable interpretation.”’” Answer (C) is an improper response to the question because it is a correct statement of claim interpretation during patent prosecution.  MPEP § 2111.01, under the heading “Plain Meaning Refers To The Meaning Given to The Term By Those Of Ordinary Skill In  The  Art,”  states  that  “[w]hen  not  defined  by  applicant  in  the  specification,  the  words  of  a  claim  must  be  given  their  plain  meaning.”  Answer  (D)  is  an  improper  response  to  the  question  because   it   is   a   correct   statement   of   claim   interpretation   during   patent   prosecution.      MPEP  §  2111.01  states  that  it  is  only  when  the  specification  provides  a  definition  for  terms  appearing in the claims can the specification be used to interpret the claim language. Answer (E) is  an  improper  response  to  the  question  because  it  is  a  correct  statement  of  claim  interpretation  during  patent  prosecution.    See  MPEP  §  2111.01,  under  the  heading  “Plain  Meaning  Refers  To  The  Meaning  Given  to  The  Term  By  Those  Of  Ordinary  Skill  In  The  Art,”  states,  in  reliance  upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of  35  U.S.C.  112,  6th  paragraph  (often  broadly  referred  to  as  means  or  step  plus  function  language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”  
11130	(E)(A), (B), (C) and (D). 	1028	t	20.  ANSWER:  The most correct answer is (E).  MPEP § 2164.01(a).
10762	(B) Because a claim is read in light of the specification, the claim may properly be\nnarrowed by interpreting it as including elements or steps disclosed in the\nspecification but not recited in the claim.	955	t	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer. MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.” Answer (A) is an improper response to the question because it is a correct statement of claim interpretation during patent prosecution.

MPEP  §  2111.01  states  that  it  is  only  when  the  specification  provides  a  definition  for  terms  appearing in the claims can the specification be used to interpret the claim language. Answer (E) is  an  improper  response  to  the  question  because  it  is  a  correct  statement  of  claim  interpretation  during  patent  prosecution.    See  MPEP  §  2111.01,  under  the  heading  “Plain  Meaning  Refers  To  The  Meaning  Given  to  The  Term  By  Those  Of  Ordinary  Skill  In  The  Art,”  states,  in  reliance  upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed.

In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”  
10763	(C) If an applicant does not define a claim term in the specification, that term is given\nits ordinary meaning in the art.	955	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer. MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.” Answer (A) is an improper response to the question because it is a correct statement of claim interpretation during patent prosecution.

10764	(D) When an explicit definition of a claim term is provided in an applicant’s\nspecification, that definition controls the interpretation of the term as it is used in\nthe claims.	955	f	47. ANSWER: (B) is the most proper answer. MPEP § 2111, under the heading “Claims Must Be Given Their Broadest Reasonable Interpretation,” states, in reference to In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969): “The court explained that ‘reading a claim in light of the specification,[’] to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed [sic, disclosed] limitations which have no express basis in the claim.” Answer (A) is an improper response to the question because it is a correct statement of claim interpretation during patent prosecution.

See  MPEP  §  2111.01,  under  the  heading  “Plain  Meaning  Refers  To  The  Meaning  Given  to  The  Term  By  Those  Of  Ordinary  Skill  In  The  Art,”  states,  in  reliance  upon In re Donaldson, 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994), that there is “one exception, and that is when an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of  35  U.S.C.  112,  6th  paragraph  (often  broadly  referred  to  as  means  or  step  plus  function  language).  In that case, the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim.”  
10783	(C) A description pursuant to 37 CFR 1.71. 	959	f	1.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01. As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the filing fee for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)  can  be  submitted  after  the  filing  date.(B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.  37  CFR  § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.   37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.81(a)  are  filed  in  the  Office.    Thus,  (B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  needed  to  obtain  a  filing  date.
10766	(A) The examiner cannot properly make the rejection because it is not based on prior\nart patents or printed publications.	956	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  MPEP  §  2133.03(b).    MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I. The Meaning Of “Sale,” and subheading “D. A Sale of  Rights  Is  Not  a  Sale  of  the  Invention  and  Will  Not  in  Itself  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “‘[a]n  assignment  or  sale  of  the  rights,  such  as  patent  rights,  in  the  invention  is  not  a  sale  of  ‘the  invention’  within  the  meaning  of  section  102(b).’”  The  sale  must  involve  the  delivery  of  the  physical  invention  itself.    Moleculon  Research  Corp.v.CBS,  Inc.,  793  F.2d  1261,  1265,  229  USPQ 805, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1986).”  (A) is incorrect.  Although reexaminations are limited to prior art patents and printed publications, that limitation is not present in original prosecution.  MPEP § 2133.03(b) states “An impermissible sale has occurred if there was a definite sale, or offer to sell,  more  than  1  year  before  the  effective  filing  date  of  the  U.S.  application  and  the  subject  matter of the sale, or offer to sell, fully anticipated the claimed invention or would have rendered the claimed invention obvious by its addition to the prior art.

See MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “III. Sale By Inventor, Assignee Or Others Associated With The Inventor In The Course Of Business,” and subheading “A. Sale Activity Need Not Be Public.”  (E) is wrong at least because an on-sale bar does not require an actual sale.  A bar can also be based on an offer to sell.  MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “II. Offers For Sale.”
10767	(B) The oral agreement was a private transaction between Buddy and his employer\nand no private transaction can provide a basis for an on-sale bar.	956	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  MPEP  §  2133.03(b).    MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I. The Meaning Of “Sale,” and subheading “D. A Sale of  Rights  Is  Not  a  Sale  of  the  Invention  and  Will  Not  in  Itself  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “‘[a]n  assignment  or  sale  of  the  rights,  such  as  patent  rights,  in  the  invention  is  not  a  sale  of  ‘the  invention’  within  the  meaning  of  section  102(b).’”  The  sale  must  involve  the  delivery  of  the  physical  invention  itself.

10768	(C) An assignment or sale of the rights in an invention and potential patent rights is\nnot a sale of “the invention” that would operate as a bar to patentability under 35\nUSC 102(b).	956	t	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  MPEP  §  2133.03(b).    MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I. The Meaning Of “Sale,” and subheading “D.

MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “II. Offers For Sale.”
10769	(D) There can be no on-sale bar even though there was no express requirement of\nconfidentiality because no one other than Buddy’s employer was present in the\nshop when Buddy was working on the stroller and the oral agreement was not\npublic.	956	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  MPEP  §  2133.03(b).    MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I. The Meaning Of “Sale,” and subheading “D.

10784	(D) At least one claim pursuant to 37 CFR 1.75.	959	f	1.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01. As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the filing fee for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)  can  be  submitted  after  the  filing  date.(B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.  37  CFR  § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.   37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.81(a)  are  filed  in  the  Office.    Thus,  (B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  needed  to  obtain  a  filing  date.

10770	(E) Although the oral agreement to assign the patent to Buddy’s employer was made\nmore than a year before the filing date, the written assignment was less than a\nyear before the filing date, and under the Statute of Frauds, sales for more than\n$500.00 require a written agreement. A rejection based on the on-sale bar can\nnever be made unless there is an actual sale.	956	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(b);  MPEP  §  2133.03(b).    MPEP § 2133.03(b), under the heading “I. The Meaning Of “Sale,” and subheading “D.

10771	(A) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing 66% by volume of gallium and 14% by\nvolume of copper.	957	f	49.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  2173.05(c),  under  the  heading  “Open-Ended  Numerical  Ranges.”  Paraphrasing  the  explanation  therein,  when  an  independent  claim  recites  a  composition  comprising  “at  least  20%  iron”  and  a  dependent  claim  sets  forth  specific  amounts  of  non-iron  ingredients  which  add  up  to100%,  apparently  to  the  exclusion  of  iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron  ingredients  are  based  on  the  weight  of  the  non-iron  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  a  composition  claimed  to  have  a  theoretical  content  greater  than  100%  (i.e.,  20-80%  of  iron,  20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may  be  read  in  theory  to  include  compositions  that  are  impossible  in  fact  to  formulate.    Here,  because  the  invention  is  a  non-theoretical  alloy,  the  sum  of  the  claimed  constituents  cannot  exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering  Claim  2  ambiguous  as  to  the  percentage  of  element  A.  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  sum  of  gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium  and  copper  components  in  Claim  2  is  100%.    (B)  is  incorrect.    “At  least  20%  iron”  includes  21%  iron,  “at  least  10%  gallium  includes  11%  gallium,  and  “at  least  10%  copper  includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because  Claim  1  uses  the  open  transition  phrase  “comprising,”  which  permits  additional  elements  to  be  added  to  the  composition.    Nothing  in  the  problem  indicates  that  an  additional  component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10772	(B) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing at least 21% by volume of iron, 11% by\nvolume of gallium, and 10.01% by volume of copper.	957	f	49.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  2173.05(c),  under  the  heading  “Open-Ended  Numerical  Ranges.”  Paraphrasing  the  explanation  therein,  when  an  independent  claim  recites  a  composition  comprising  “at  least  20%  iron”  and  a  dependent  claim  sets  forth  specific  amounts  of  non-iron  ingredients  which  add  up  to100%,  apparently  to  the  exclusion  of  iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron  ingredients  are  based  on  the  weight  of  the  non-iron  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  a  composition  claimed  to  have  a  theoretical  content  greater  than  100%  (i.e.,  20-80%  of  iron,  20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may  be  read  in  theory  to  include  compositions  that  are  impossible  in  fact  to  formulate.    Here,  because  the  invention  is  a  non-theoretical  alloy,  the  sum  of  the  claimed  constituents  cannot  exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering  Claim  2  ambiguous  as  to  the  percentage  of  element  A.  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  sum  of  gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium  and  copper  components  in  Claim  2  is  100%.    (B)  is  incorrect.    “At  least  20%  iron”  includes  21%  iron,  “at  least  10%  gallium  includes  11%  gallium,  and  “at  least  10%  copper  includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because  Claim  1  uses  the  open  transition  phrase  “comprising,”  which  permits  additional  elements  to  be  added  to  the  composition.    Nothing  in  the  problem  indicates  that  an  additional  component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10773	(C) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing 20% by volume of iron, 10% by\nvolume of gallium, and 10% by volume of copper.	957	f	49.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  2173.05(c),  under  the  heading  “Open-Ended  Numerical  Ranges.”  Paraphrasing  the  explanation  therein,  when  an  independent  claim  recites  a  composition  comprising  “at  least  20%  iron”  and  a  dependent  claim  sets  forth  specific  amounts  of  non-iron  ingredients  which  add  up  to100%,  apparently  to  the  exclusion  of  iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron  ingredients  are  based  on  the  weight  of  the  non-iron  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  a  composition  claimed  to  have  a  theoretical  content  greater  than  100%  (i.e.,  20-80%  of  iron,  20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may  be  read  in  theory  to  include  compositions  that  are  impossible  in  fact  to  formulate.    Here,  because  the  invention  is  a  non-theoretical  alloy,  the  sum  of  the  claimed  constituents  cannot  exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering  Claim  2  ambiguous  as  to  the  percentage  of  element  A.  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  sum  of  gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium  and  copper  components  in  Claim  2  is  100%.    (B)  is  incorrect.    “At  least  20%  iron”  includes  21%  iron,  “at  least  10%  gallium  includes  11%  gallium,  and  “at  least  10%  copper  includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because  Claim  1  uses  the  open  transition  phrase  “comprising,”  which  permits  additional  elements  to  be  added  to  the  composition.    Nothing  in  the  problem  indicates  that  an  additional  component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10774	(D) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing 54% by volume of copper and 27% by\nvolume of gallium.	957	t	49.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  2173.05(c),  under  the  heading  “Open-Ended  Numerical  Ranges.”  Paraphrasing  the  explanation  therein,  when  an  independent  claim  recites  a  composition  comprising  “at  least  20%  iron”  and  a  dependent  claim  sets  forth  specific  amounts  of  non-iron  ingredients  which  add  up  to100%,  apparently  to  the  exclusion  of  iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron  ingredients  are  based  on  the  weight  of  the  non-iron  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  a  composition  claimed  to  have  a  theoretical  content  greater  than  100%  (i.e.,  20-80%  of  iron,  20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may  be  read  in  theory  to  include  compositions  that  are  impossible  in  fact  to  formulate.    Here,  because  the  invention  is  a  non-theoretical  alloy,  the  sum  of  the  claimed  constituents  cannot  exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering  Claim  2  ambiguous  as  to  the  percentage  of  element  A.  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  sum  of  gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium  and  copper  components  in  Claim  2  is  100%.    (B)  is  incorrect.    “At  least  20%  iron”  includes  21%  iron,  “at  least  10%  gallium  includes  11%  gallium,  and  “at  least  10%  copper  includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because  Claim  1  uses  the  open  transition  phrase  “comprising,”  which  permits  additional  elements  to  be  added  to  the  composition.    Nothing  in  the  problem  indicates  that  an  additional  component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
11131	(A)The  abandoned  parent  application  of  a  divisional  application.    A  patent  wasgranted  on  the  divisional  application,  which  refers  to  the  abandoned  parentapplication.  	1029	f	21.  ANSWER:  (D) is correct.  (A) is wrong.  37 C.F.R. § 1.14(e)(2); MPEP § 103, application files are available upon request because the divisional application refers to the abandoned parent application, and the division issued as a patent, causing the application to be open to inspection.  (B), (C) and (E) are wrong and (D) is correct.  MPEP § 301.01. 
11783	(E)(A), (B) (C), and (D).	1165	f	see MPEP 706.02(b)
10775	(E) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing at least 1% by volume of silver.	957	f	49.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  2173.05(c),  under  the  heading  “Open-Ended  Numerical  Ranges.”  Paraphrasing  the  explanation  therein,  when  an  independent  claim  recites  a  composition  comprising  “at  least  20%  iron”  and  a  dependent  claim  sets  forth  specific  amounts  of  non-iron  ingredients  which  add  up  to100%,  apparently  to  the  exclusion  of  iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron  ingredients  are  based  on  the  weight  of  the  non-iron  ingredients.  On  the  other  hand,  a  composition  claimed  to  have  a  theoretical  content  greater  than  100%  (i.e.,  20-80%  of  iron,  20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may  be  read  in  theory  to  include  compositions  that  are  impossible  in  fact  to  formulate.    Here,  because  the  invention  is  a  non-theoretical  alloy,  the  sum  of  the  claimed  constituents  cannot  exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight.  In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron.  Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering  Claim  2  ambiguous  as  to  the  percentage  of  element  A.  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  sum  of  gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron.  Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron.  Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium  and  copper  components  in  Claim  2  is  100%.    (B)  is  incorrect.    “At  least  20%  iron”  includes  21%  iron,  “at  least  10%  gallium  includes  11%  gallium,  and  “at  least  10%  copper  includes 10.01% copper.  (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because  Claim  1  uses  the  open  transition  phrase  “comprising,”  which  permits  additional  elements  to  be  added  to  the  composition.    Nothing  in  the  problem  indicates  that  an  additional  component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
10776	(A) One hundred thirty-six.	958	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.75; MPEP § 608.01(n). As explained in MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “Multiple Dependent Claims,” subheading “Acceptable Multiple Dependent Claim Wording” the multiple dependent claim wording of new claims 16-27 is proper. See, for example, “any one of the preceding claims,” and “in any of claims 1-3 or 7-9.” 37 CFR § 1.75(c) states “For fee calculation purposes under § 1.16, a multiple dependent claim will be considered to be that number of claims to which direct reference is made therein.” Therefore, claims 16-27 would each have a claim value of eleven and the total number of claims for fee calculation is one hundred forty-seven (12 x 11 = 132 + 15 = 147). Answers (A) and (B) are incorrect because they are not the correct total. Answer (C) is incorrect because the multiple dependent claims have not been calculated in accordance with 37 CFR § 1.75. Answer (E) is incorrect because the question asks for the total after the amendment adding claims 16-27 has been entered. 
10777	(B) One hundred thirty-five.	958	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.75; MPEP § 608.01(n).

10781	(A) The basic filing fee required by 37 CFR 1.16(a).	959	t	1.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01. As provided in MPEP § 601.01(a), the filing fee for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b)  can  be  submitted  after  the  filing  date.(B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.  37  CFR  § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.   37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is granted on the date on which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  37  CFR  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required  by  37  CFR  §  1.81(a)  are  filed  in  the  Office.    Thus,  (B),  (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  needed  to  obtain  a  filing  date.
10786	(A)  Reject  all  the  claims  based  upon  a  broadening  reissue  outside  the  two  year  statutory  period  authorized  by  35  USC  251  since  applicant  did  not  file  a  broadened reissue claim at the time of filing.	960	f	2.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.  MPEP  §§  1403  and  1412.03,  under  the  heading  “When  A  Broadened  Claim  Can  Be  Presented.”  A  broadening  reissue  claim  must  be  filed within the two years from the grant of the original patent.  (D) is the most correct and the examiner  should  examine  the  case  as  any  other  application  and  address  appropriate  issues  concerning reissue examination.  See Switzer v. Sockman, 333 F.2d 935, 142 USPQ 226 (CCPA 1964) (a similar rule in interferences).  Since applicant filed the amendment by Express Mail, the amendment  is  treated  as  being  filed  with  the  USPTO  on  the  date  of  deposit  with  the  US  Postal  Service.  Therefore, (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect answers.  A reissue application can be granted a filing date without an oath or declaration, or without the filing fee being present.  See 37 CFR § 1.53(f).    Applicant  will  be  given  a  period  of  time  to  provide  the  missing  parts  and  to  pay  the  surcharge  under    37  CFR  §  1.16(e).  See  MPEP  §  1410.01.  Choice  (E)  is  not  correct  since  the  mere deletion of an element of a claim does not automatically raise a ground of rejection based on the recapture doctrine.  See MPEP § 1412.02. 
10787	(B)  Reject  all  the  claims  based  upon  a  broadening  reissue  outside  the  two  year  statutory period authorized by 35 USC 251 since applicant did not file a claim to a broadened reissue claim within the two year period set by 35 USC 251.	960	f	2.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.  MPEP  §§  1403  and  1412.03,  under  the  heading  “When  A  Broadened  Claim  Can  Be  Presented.”  A  broadening  reissue  claim  must  be  filed within the two years from the grant of the original patent.  (D) is the most correct and the examiner  should  examine  the  case  as  any  other  application  and  address  appropriate  issues  concerning reissue examination.  See Switzer v.

Since applicant filed the amendment by Express Mail, the amendment  is  treated  as  being  filed  with  the  USPTO  on  the  date  of  deposit  with  the  US  Postal  Service.  Therefore, (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect answers.  A reissue application can be granted a filing date without an oath or declaration, or without the filing fee being present.  See 37 CFR § 1.53(f).    Applicant  will  be  given  a  period  of  time  to  provide  the  missing  parts  and  to  pay  the  surcharge  under    37  CFR  §  1.16(e).  See  MPEP  §  1410.01.  Choice  (E)  is  not  correct  since  the  mere deletion of an element of a claim does not automatically raise a ground of rejection based on the recapture doctrine.  See MPEP § 1412.02. 
10788	(C)  Reject  all  the  claims  based  upon  a  broadening  reissue  outside  the  two  year  statutory  period  authorized  by  35  USC  251  since  applicant’s  indication  in  the  transmittal  letter  indicated  that  the  filing  of  the  reissue  application  was  a  narrowing reissue and that the broadening amendment was not permissible even if filed within the two-years from the grant of the original patent. 	960	f	2.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.  MPEP  §§  1403  and  1412.03,  under  the  heading  “When  A  Broadened  Claim  Can  Be  Presented.”  A  broadening  reissue  claim  must  be  filed within the two years from the grant of the original patent.

10789	(D)  Determine  that  the  application  is  a  proper  broadening  reissue  and  perform  an  examination and issue an Office action in due course. 	960	t	2.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.  MPEP  §§  1403  and  1412.03,  under  the  heading  “When  A  Broadened  Claim  Can  Be  Presented.”  A  broadening  reissue  claim  must  be  filed within the two years from the grant of the original patent.

10790	(E) Determine that the application is a proper broadening reissue and reject the claims under the recapture doctrine since the claims are broader than the issued claims.	960	f	2.  ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.  MPEP  §§  1403  and  1412.03,  under  the  heading  “When  A  Broadened  Claim  Can  Be  Presented.”  A  broadening  reissue  claim  must  be  filed within the two years from the grant of the original patent.

Choice  (E)  is  not  correct  since  the  mere deletion of an element of a claim does not automatically raise a ground of rejection based on the recapture doctrine.  See MPEP § 1412.02. 
11813	(E)None of the above	1172	f	12. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2292. As to (A) see MPEP 2216. As to (B) see MPEP 2258.01 (C), see MPEP § 2285 regarding merger of reissues and reexamination proceedings. As to (E), (D) is true.
10791	(A)  Argue  that  all  limitations  in  the  claim  must  be  given  weight  and  that  rejection  must be withdrawn because the reference does not disclose the claimed method of making steps. 	961	f	3.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   correct.      MPEP   §   2113,   under   the   heading   “Once   A   Product   Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states  “[o]nce  the  examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed.  Cir.  1983).”    (A)  is  incorrect  because  the  patentability  of  product-by-process  claims  is  based on the product itself.  See In re Thorpe, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  Where the end products are the same, the process of making limitations do not have to be given weight in ex parte  examination.    See  Atlantic  Thermoplastics  Co.  v.  Faytex  Corp.,  23 USPQ2d 1481, 1490-91  (Fed.  Cir.  1992)  (product-by-process  claims  are  treated  differently  for  patentability  purposes during ex parte examination in the USPTO than for infringement and validity purposes during litigation).  (B) is incorrect because "[o]nce the Examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed  product  and  the  prior  art  product."    MPEP § 2113.  "To the extent that the process limitations distinguish the products over the prior art,   they   must   be   given   the   same   consideration   as   traditional   product   characteristics."      In re Hallman,  210  USPQ  609,  611  (CCPA  1981).    Thus,  (C)  is  correct  because  applicant  can  show  by  factual  arguments  and/or  declarations  or  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.132  that  the  method  of  making  produces  a  different  product  and  that  the  differences  are  unobvious.    (D)  is  incorrect because it does not tend to show that the products are different.  (E) is incorrect because the inventor's awareness of prior art is of no consequence to patentability. 
10792	(B)  Argue  that  the  examiner  has  not  carried  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  shoes  are  identical. 	961	f	3.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   correct.      MPEP   §   2113,   under   the   heading   “Once   A   Product   Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states  “[o]nce  the  examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed product and the prior art product.

Thus,  (C)  is  correct  because  applicant  can  show  by  factual  arguments  and/or  declarations  or  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.132  that  the  method  of  making  produces  a  different  product  and  that  the  differences  are  unobvious.    (D)  is  incorrect because it does not tend to show that the products are different.  (E) is incorrect because the inventor's awareness of prior art is of no consequence to patentability. 
10793	(C)  Present  evidence  why  the  steps  of  the  claimed  process  produce  a  patentably  different structure. 	961	t	3.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   correct.      MPEP   §   2113,   under   the   heading   “Once   A   Product   Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states  “[o]nce  the  examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed product and the prior art product.

In re Hallman,  210  USPQ  609,  611  (CCPA  1981).    Thus,  (C)  is  correct  because  applicant  can  show  by  factual  arguments  and/or  declarations  or  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.132  that  the  method  of  making  produces  a  different  product  and  that  the  differences  are  unobvious.    (D)  is  incorrect because it does not tend to show that the products are different.  (E) is incorrect because the inventor's awareness of prior art is of no consequence to patentability. 
10794	(D)  Submit  a  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.132  by  the  author  of  the  publication  describing in more detail how the shoe in the publication was made by a different method. 	961	f	3.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   correct.      MPEP   §   2113,   under   the   heading   “Once   A   Product   Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states  “[o]nce  the  examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed.  Cir.  1983).”    (A)  is  incorrect  because  the  patentability  of  product-by-process  claims  is  based on the product itself.  See In re Thorpe, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).  Where the end products are the same, the process of making limitations do not have to be given weight in ex parte  examination.

MPEP   §   2163,   under   the   heading   “GENERAL    PRINCIPLES    GOVERNING    COMPLIANCE    WITH    THE    "WRITTEN    DESCRIPTION" REQUIREMENT FOR APPLICATIONS,” and subheading “New or Amended Claims,”  states  “A  claim  that  omits  an  element  which  applicant  describes  as  an  essential  or  critical feature of the invention originally disclosed does not comply with the written description requirement.  See  Gentry  Gallery,  134  F.3d  at  1480,  45  USPQ2d  at  1503;  In  re  Sus,  306  F.2d  494, 504, 134 USPQ 301, 309 (CCPA 1962) (‘[O]ne skilled in this art would not be taught by the written description of the invention in the specification that any 'aryl or substituted aryl radical' would be suitable for the purposes of the invention but rather that only certain aryl radicals and certain  specifically  substituted  aryl  radicals  [i.e.,  aryl  azides]  would  be  suitable  for  such  purposes.’).”    (A),  (B),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.    Each  lists  a  proper  way  to  demonstrate  satisfaction  of  the  written  description  requirement.    MPEP  §  2163.02,  under  the  heading  “STANDARD FOR DETERMINING COMPLIANCE WITH THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENT,”   provides   that   the   written   description   requirement   is   met   “when   the   specification conveys with reasonable clarity to those skilled in the art that, as of the filing date sought, applicant was in possession of the invention as now claimed.  See, e.g., Vas-Cath, Inc. v. Mahurkar, 935 F.2d 1555, 1563-64, 19 USPQ2d 1111, 1117 (Fed.

11132	(B)  Assignment  document  relating  to  both  an  issued  patent  and  a  patent  application  not published under 35 USC 122(b). 	1029	f	21.  ANSWER:  (D) is correct.  (A) is wrong.  37 C.F.R. § 1.14(e)(2); MPEP § 103, application files are available upon request because the divisional application refers to the abandoned parent application, and the division issued as a patent, causing the application to be open to inspection.  (B), (C) and (E) are wrong and (D) is correct.  MPEP § 301.01.

10806	(A) Point is under a duty to disclose material information to the USPTO. 	964	f	6. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP § 2001.05.  37 CFR §  1.56(a)  sets  forth  a  duty  to  disclose  information  that  is  material  to  patentability.    MPEP  § 2001.05 states that “information is not material unless is comes within the definition of 37 CFR 1.56(b)(1) or (b)(2).  If information is not material, there is no duty to disclose the information to the Office.”  The information that moon dust was never actually used is not material as defined under 37 CFR § 1.56(b)(1) or (2) which state that information is material if “(b)(1) It establishes, by  itself  or  in  combination  with  other  information,  a  prima  facie  case  of  unpatentability  of  a  claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in: (i) Opposing an argument  of  unpatentability  relied  on  b  y  the  Office  or,  (ii)  Asserting  an  argument  of  patentability.”    That  the  use  of  the  moon  dust  as  part  of  an  erasure  formulation  was  only  theorized and not actually used is acceptable as is an example for making it.  MPEP § 608.01(p), II,  under  the  heading  “Simulated  or  Predicted  Test  Results  Or  Prophetic  Examples,”  states  that  “[s]imulated or predicted test results and prophetical examples (paper examples) are permitted in patent   applications.   ...   Paper   examples   describe   the   manner   and   process   of   making   an   embodiment of the invention which has not actually been conducted.”  Care, however, must be taken  not  to  state  that  an  experiment  was  actually  run  or  conducted  when  it  was  not  and  that  “[n]o  results  should  be  presented  as  actual  results  unless  they  have  actually  been  achieved.”    MPEP  §  2004,  item  8.    (A)  is  incorrect.    37  CFR  §  1.56(a)  requires  that  individuals  associated  with the filing and prosecution of a patent application have a duty to disclose information to the Office.    37  CFR  §  1.56(c)  defines  which  individuals  are  associated  with  the  filing  and  prosecution  of  a  patent  application  and  that    “(c)  Individuals  associated  with  the  filing  or  prosecution  of  a  patent  application  within  the  meaning  of  this  section  are:  (1)  Each  inventor  named in the application; (2) Each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the application; and (3) Every other person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor, with the assignee or with anyone to whom there  is  an  obligation  to  assign  the  application.”      Point  is  part  of  the  Sales  department  and  no  facts  were  presented  that  substantively  involved  him  in  the  preparation  or  prosecution  of  the  application.    Additionally,  as  noted  in  the  explanation  relating  answer  to  (D),  the  information  given  to  Point  by  Tip  was  not  material  information.  (B)  is  incorrect.    While  Tip  would  be  an  individual identified under 37 CFR § 1.56(c), there is no material information to be disclosed as noted in the explanation to (D).  (C) is incorrect.  As noted in the explanation relating to (D), the information is not material.  Additionally, as noted in the explanation to answer (A), Point is not an  individual  defined  by  37  CFR  1.56(c)  as  owing  a  duty.    (E)  is  incorrect.  As  there  is  no  requirement that it be explicitly stated that an invention has or has not been actually conducted, as  noted  in  the  explanation  of  (D),  the  prosecution  need  not  be  continued  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  an  information  disclosure  statement  regarding  the  development  of  the  moon  rock  erasure formulation. 
10807	(B) Tip is under a duty to disclose his concern regarding the moon rock information to the USPTO. 	964	f	6. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP § 2001.05.  37 CFR §  1.56(a)  sets  forth  a  duty  to  disclose  information  that  is  material  to  patentability.    MPEP  § 2001.05 states that “information is not material unless is comes within the definition of 37 CFR 1.56(b)(1) or (b)(2).  If information is not material, there is no duty to disclose the information to the Office.”  The information that moon dust was never actually used is not material as defined under 37 CFR § 1.56(b)(1) or (2) which state that information is material if “(b)(1) It establishes, by  itself  or  in  combination  with  other  information,  a  prima  facie  case  of  unpatentability  of  a  claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in: (i) Opposing an argument  of  unpatentability  relied  on  b  y  the  Office  or,  (ii)  Asserting  an  argument  of  patentability.”    That  the  use  of  the  moon  dust  as  part  of  an  erasure  formulation  was  only  theorized and not actually used is acceptable as is an example for making it.

Additionally,  as  noted  in  the  explanation  relating  answer  to  (D),  the  information  given  to  Point  by  Tip  was  not  material  information.  (B)  is  incorrect.    While  Tip  would  be  an  individual identified under 37 CFR § 1.56(c), there is no material information to be disclosed as noted in the explanation to (D).  (C) is incorrect.  As noted in the explanation relating to (D), the information is not material.  Additionally, as noted in the explanation to answer (A), Point is not an  individual  defined  by  37  CFR  1.56(c)  as  owing  a  duty.    (E)  is  incorrect.  As  there  is  no  requirement that it be explicitly stated that an invention has or has not been actually conducted, as  noted  in  the  explanation  of  (D),  the  prosecution  need  not  be  continued  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  an  information  disclosure  statement  regarding  the  development  of  the  moon  rock  erasure formulation. 
10808	(C)  Both  Point  and  Tip  are  under  a  duty  to  disclose  material  information  to  the  UPSTO. 	964	f	6. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP § 2001.05.  37 CFR §  1.56(a)  sets  forth  a  duty  to  disclose  information  that  is  material  to  patentability.    MPEP  § 2001.05 states that “information is not material unless is comes within the definition of 37 CFR 1.56(b)(1) or (b)(2).  If information is not material, there is no duty to disclose the information to the Office.”  The information that moon dust was never actually used is not material as defined under 37 CFR § 1.56(b)(1) or (2) which state that information is material if “(b)(1) It establishes, by  itself  or  in  combination  with  other  information,  a  prima  facie  case  of  unpatentability  of  a  claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in: (i) Opposing an argument  of  unpatentability  relied  on  b  y  the  Office  or,  (ii)  Asserting  an  argument  of  patentability.”    That  the  use  of  the  moon  dust  as  part  of  an  erasure  formulation  was  only  theorized and not actually used is acceptable as is an example for making it.

Additionally,  as  noted  in  the  explanation  relating  answer  to  (D),  the  information  given  to  Point  by  Tip  was  not  material  information.  (B)  is  incorrect.    While  Tip  would  be  an  individual identified under 37 CFR § 1.56(c), there is no material information to be disclosed as noted in the explanation to (D).  (C) is incorrect.  As noted in the explanation relating to (D), the information is not material.  Additionally, as noted in the explanation to answer (A), Point is not an  individual  defined  by  37  CFR  1.56(c)  as  owing  a  duty.    (E)  is  incorrect.  As  there  is  no  requirement that it be explicitly stated that an invention has or has not been actually conducted, as  noted  in  the  explanation  of  (D),  the  prosecution  need  not  be  continued  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  an  information  disclosure  statement  regarding  the  development  of  the  moon  rock  erasure formulation. 
10809	(D)       There   is   no   duty   to   disclose   information   regarding   how   the   moon   rock   formulation was developed to the USPTO. 	964	t	6. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP § 2001.05.  37 CFR §  1.56(a)  sets  forth  a  duty  to  disclose  information  that  is  material  to  patentability.

10810	(E)  Inasmuch  as  the  application  is  allowed,  an  appropriate  Request  for  Continued  Prosecution  pursuant  to  37  CFR  1.114  needs  to  be  filed  accompanied  by  a  information  disclosure  regarding  the  possibility  of  rejections  under  35  USC  101,  and 112, first paragraph. 	964	f	6. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.56; MPEP § 2001.05.  37 CFR §  1.56(a)  sets  forth  a  duty  to  disclose  information  that  is  material  to  patentability.    MPEP  § 2001.05 states that “information is not material unless is comes within the definition of 37 CFR 1.56(b)(1) or (b)(2).  If information is not material, there is no duty to disclose the information to the Office.”  The information that moon dust was never actually used is not material as defined under 37 CFR § 1.56(b)(1) or (2) which state that information is material if “(b)(1) It establishes, by  itself  or  in  combination  with  other  information,  a  prima  facie  case  of  unpatentability  of  a  claim; or (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in: (i) Opposing an argument  of  unpatentability  relied  on  b  y  the  Office  or,  (ii)  Asserting  an  argument  of  patentability.”    That  the  use  of  the  moon  dust  as  part  of  an  erasure  formulation  was  only  theorized and not actually used is acceptable as is an example for making it.  MPEP § 608.01(p), II,  under  the  heading  “Simulated  or  Predicted  Test  Results  Or  Prophetic  Examples,”  states  that  “[s]imulated or predicted test results and prophetical examples (paper examples) are permitted in patent   applications.   ...   Paper   examples   describe   the   manner   and   process   of   making   an   embodiment of the invention which has not actually been conducted.”  Care, however, must be taken  not  to  state  that  an  experiment  was  actually  run  or  conducted  when  it  was  not  and  that  “[n]o  results  should  be  presented  as  actual  results  unless  they  have  actually  been  achieved.”    MPEP  §  2004,  item  8.    (A)  is  incorrect.    37  CFR  §  1.56(a)  requires  that  individuals  associated  with the filing and prosecution of a patent application have a duty to disclose information to the Office.    37  CFR  §  1.56(c)  defines  which  individuals  are  associated  with  the  filing  and  prosecution  of  a  patent  application  and  that    “(c)  Individuals  associated  with  the  filing  or  prosecution  of  a  patent  application  within  the  meaning  of  this  section  are:  (1)  Each  inventor  named in the application; (2) Each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the application; and (3) Every other person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor, with the assignee or with anyone to whom there  is  an  obligation  to  assign  the  application.”      Point  is  part  of  the  Sales  department  and  no  facts  were  presented  that  substantively  involved  him  in  the  preparation  or  prosecution  of  the  application.    Additionally,  as  noted  in  the  explanation  relating  answer  to  (D),  the  information  given  to  Point  by  Tip  was  not  material  information.  (B)  is  incorrect.    While  Tip  would  be  an  individual identified under 37 CFR § 1.56(c), there is no material information to be disclosed as noted in the explanation to (D).  (C) is incorrect.  As noted in the explanation relating to (D), the information is not material.  Additionally, as noted in the explanation to answer (A), Point is not an  individual  defined  by  37  CFR  1.56(c)  as  owing  a  duty.    (E)  is  incorrect.  As  there  is  no  requirement that it be explicitly stated that an invention has or has not been actually conducted, as  noted  in  the  explanation  of  (D),  the  prosecution  need  not  be  continued  for  the  purpose  of  supplying  an  information  disclosure  statement  regarding  the  development  of  the  moon  rock  erasure formulation.

See MPEP § 1410.01.  (A), (B) and (D) are clearly incorrect since the inventors  and  assignee  would  be  barred  from  a  broadening  reissue  if  filed  after  the  two  year  period set in the statute.  (C) is incorrect since the reissue application was filed without at least one broadening claim prior to the expiration of the two-year time period set in 35 U.S.C. § 251. 
10832	(B)  Wait  to  file  the  reissue  application  until  the  signatures  of  at  least  three  inventors  can  be  obtained.

10836	(A) A claim to a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild.	970	f	12.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2106(IV)(B)(2)(b)(i),  under  the  heading   “Safe   Harbors,”   subheading   “Independent   Physical   Acts   (Post-Computer   Process   Activity),”  states  that  “[e]xamples  of  this  type  of  statutory  process  include  ...[a]  method  of  controlling  a  mechanical  robot  which  relies  upon  storing  data  in  a  computer  that  represents  various  types  of  mechanical  movements  of  the  robot,  using  a  computer  processor  to  calculate  positioning  of  the  robot  in  relation  to  given  tasks  to  be  performed  by  the  robot,  and  controlling  the robot ’s movement and position based on the calculated position.” (A) is a true statement, and is therefore an incorrect answer.  As set forth in MPEP § 2105 a “ new mineral discovered in the earth  or  a  new  plant  found  in  the  wild  is  not  patentable  subject  matter.”    (B)  is  an  incorrect  answer.    As  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  2106(IV)(B)(2)(b)(i),  under  the  heading  “Safe  Harbors,”  subheading  “Manipulation  of  Data  Representing  Physical  Objects  or  Activities  (Pre-Computer  Process  Activity),”  states  that  “[e]xamples  of  claimed  processes  that  do  not  limit  the  claimed  invention  to  pre-computing  safe  harbor  include:  .  .  .  -  selecting  a  set  of  arbitrary  measurement  point  values  ([In  re]  Sarkar,  588  F.2d  [1330]  at  1331,  200  USPQ  [132]  at  135).”    (D)  is  an  incorrect  answer.    MPEP  §  2106(IV)(B)(2)(b)(i)  under  the  heading  “Safe  Harbors,”  subheading  “Independent  Physical  Acts  (Post-Computer  Process  Activity),”  states  that  “[e]xamples  of  claimed  process  that  do  not  achieve  a  practical  application  include:-step  of  ‘updating  alarm  limits’ found to constitute changing the number value of a variable to represent the result of the calculation  (Parker  v.  Flook,  437  U.S.584,  585,  198  USPQ  193,  195  (1978).”    (E)  is  a  true  statement,  and  therefore  is  an  incorrect  answer.    MPEP  §  2106(IV)(B)(1),  under  the  heading  “Nonstatutory Subject Matter” states “[In re]Warmerdam, 33 F.3d [1354,] at 1361, 31 USPQ2d [1754,] at 1760 (claim to a data structure per se held nonstatutory).”

11135	(E)Assignment  document  relating  to  both  an  abandoned  patent  application  not  published under 35 USC 122(b) and a pending reissue application. 	1029	f	21.  ANSWER:  (D) is correct.  (A) is wrong.  37 C.F.R. § 1.14(e)(2); MPEP § 103, application files are available upon request because the divisional application refers to the abandoned parent application, and the division issued as a patent, causing the application to be open to inspection.  (B), (C) and (E) are wrong and (D) is correct.  MPEP § 301.01.

MPEP  §  2106(IV)(B)(1),  under  the  heading  “Nonstatutory Subject Matter” states “[In re]Warmerdam, 33 F.3d [1354,] at 1361, 31 USPQ2d [1754,] at 1760 (claim to a data structure per se held nonstatutory).”
10841	(A)  An  argument  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  low  melting  point  of  150° F, supported by an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F.	971	t	13. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process  Claims  Are  Not  Limited  To  The  Manipulations  Of  The  Recited  Steps,  Only  The  Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “’even though product-by-process claims are limited by and  defined  by  the  process,  determination  of  patentability  is  based  on  the  product  itself.  The  patentability  of  a  product  does  not  depend  on  its  method  of  production.  If  the  product  in  the  product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y  is  the  same  as  or  obvious  over  the  patented  mixture  Y.    MPEP  §  2113,  under  the  heading  “Once  A  Product  Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to  be  the  same  or  similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed  product  and  the  prior  art  product.  In  re  Marosi,  710  F.2d  798,  802,  218  USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is  germane  to  the  issue  of  patentability  of  the  product-by-process  claim.  Accordingly,  a  comparison  of  the  results  obtained  by  conducting  the  process  recited  in  the  claim  versus  the  process  used  by  patent  A  and  which  shows  that  the  claimed  product  exhibits  an  unexpectedly  lower  melting  point  would  be  a  persuasive  demonstration  that,  although  the  products  would  appear  to  be  substantially  identical,  in  fact,  they  are  patentably  different.  Ex  parte  Gray,  10  USPQ2d  1922  (Bd.  Pat.  App.  &  Inter.  1989).  Therefore,  the  best  reply  to  the  outstanding  rejection  would  be  to  argue  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  lower  melting  point  and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture  with  higher  melting  point  as  compared  to  the  claimed  product.  (B)  is  incorrect.  The  patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not  process  steps.  (C)  is  incorrect.    The  declaration  is  conclusory,  as  opposed  to  being  factual.  Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion  Evidence,”  “Although  an  affidavit  or  declaration  which  states  only  conclusions  may  have  some  probative  value,  such  an  affidavit  or  declaration  may  have  little  weight  when  considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C).  (D) like (B), is incorrect for the same reason discussed for (B).  (E) is incorrect.  Like (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in (A).  
10842	(B)  An  argument  that  the  processes  used  by  applicant  and  patent  A  are  different,  supported by a third-party declaration stating only that the processes are different.	971	f	13. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process  Claims  Are  Not  Limited  To  The  Manipulations  Of  The  Recited  Steps,  Only  The  Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “’even though product-by-process claims are limited by and  defined  by  the  process,  determination  of  patentability  is  based  on  the  product  itself.

Therefore,  the  best  reply  to  the  outstanding  rejection  would  be  to  argue  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  lower  melting  point  and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture  with  higher  melting  point  as  compared  to  the  claimed  product.  (B)  is  incorrect.  The  patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not  process  steps.  (C)  is  incorrect.    The  declaration  is  conclusory,  as  opposed  to  being  factual.  Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion  Evidence,”  “Although  an  affidavit  or  declaration  which  states  only  conclusions  may  have  some  probative  value,  such  an  affidavit  or  declaration  may  have  little  weight  when  considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C).  (D) like (B), is incorrect for the same reason discussed for (B).  (E) is incorrect.  Like (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in (A).  
10845	(E)  An  argument  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  low  melting  point  of  150°  F  because  the  claimed  mixture  Y  has  a  melting  point  of  150°  F  and  the  mixture Y of patent A has a melting point of 300° F.	971	f	13. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process  Claims  Are  Not  Limited  To  The  Manipulations  Of  The  Recited  Steps,  Only  The  Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “’even though product-by-process claims are limited by and  defined  by  the  process,  determination  of  patentability  is  based  on  the  product  itself.  The  patentability  of  a  product  does  not  depend  on  its  method  of  production.  If  the  product  in  the  product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y  is  the  same  as  or  obvious  over  the  patented  mixture  Y.    MPEP  §  2113,  under  the  heading  “Once  A  Product  Appearing  To  Be  Substantially  Identical  Is  Found  And  A  35  U.S.C.  102/103  Rejection  Made,  The  Burden  Shifts  To  The  Applicant  To  Show  An  Unobvious  Difference,”  states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to  be  the  same  or  similar  to  that  of  the  prior  art,  although  produced  by  a  different  process,  the  burden  shifts  to  applicant  to  come  forward  with  evidence  establishing  an  unobvious  difference  between  the  claimed  product  and  the  prior  art  product.  In  re  Marosi,  710  F.2d  798,  802,  218  USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is  germane  to  the  issue  of  patentability  of  the  product-by-process  claim.  Accordingly,  a  comparison  of  the  results  obtained  by  conducting  the  process  recited  in  the  claim  versus  the  process  used  by  patent  A  and  which  shows  that  the  claimed  product  exhibits  an  unexpectedly  lower  melting  point  would  be  a  persuasive  demonstration  that,  although  the  products  would  appear  to  be  substantially  identical,  in  fact,  they  are  patentably  different.  Ex  parte  Gray,  10  USPQ2d  1922  (Bd.  Pat.  App.  &  Inter.  1989).  Therefore,  the  best  reply  to  the  outstanding  rejection  would  be  to  argue  that  the  claimed  product  has  an  unexpectedly  lower  melting  point  and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture  with  higher  melting  point  as  compared  to  the  claimed  product.  (B)  is  incorrect.  The  patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not  process  steps.  (C)  is  incorrect.    The  declaration  is  conclusory,  as  opposed  to  being  factual.  Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion  Evidence,”  “Although  an  affidavit  or  declaration  which  states  only  conclusions  may  have  some  probative  value,  such  an  affidavit  or  declaration  may  have  little  weight  when  considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C).  (D) like (B), is incorrect for the same reason discussed for (B).  (E) is incorrect.  Like (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in (A).  
10846	(A) None, the publication has no prior art date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e)	972	f	14. ANSWER:   The correct answer is answer (E).  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1) in general and Example 7 in particular.  (A) is not correct as the publication under 35 U.S.C. § 122(b) does have a prior art date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e).  (B) and (D) are not correct because March 27, 2002 and December  1,  2000  are  not  the  earliest  prior  art  date  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    The  publication  has  an  earlier  prior  art  date  than  March  27,  2002  and  December  1,  2000  because  of  its  benefit/priority  claims  to  the  international  application  and  the  provisional  application.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)(1).    (C)  is  not  correct  as  it  is  not  a  filing  date  for  any  application  in  this  question.

The  publication  has  an  earlier  prior  art  date  than  March  27,  2002  and  December  1,  2000  because  of  its  benefit/priority  claims  to  the  international  application  and  the  provisional  application.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)(1).    (C)  is  not  correct  as  it  is  not  a  filing  date  for  any  application  in  this  question.
10849	(D) December 1, 2000 	972	f	14. ANSWER:   The correct answer is answer (E).  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1) in general and Example 7 in particular.  (A) is not correct as the publication under 35 U.S.C. § 122(b) does have a prior art date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e).  (B) and (D) are not correct because March 27, 2002 and December  1,  2000  are  not  the  earliest  prior  art  date  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    The  publication  has  an  earlier  prior  art  date  than  March  27,  2002  and  December  1,  2000  because  of  its  benefit/priority  claims  to  the  international  application  and  the  provisional  application.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)(1).    (C)  is  not  correct  as  it  is  not  a  filing  date  for  any  application  in  this  question.
10850	(E) December 2, 1999	972	t	14. ANSWER:   The correct answer is answer (E).  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1) in general and Example 7 in particular.  (A) is not correct as the publication under 35 U.S.C. § 122(b) does have a prior art date under 35 U.S.C. 102(e).  (B) and (D) are not correct because March 27, 2002 and December  1,  2000  are  not  the  earliest  prior  art  date  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    The  publication  has  an  earlier  prior  art  date  than  March  27,  2002  and  December  1,  2000  because  of  its  benefit/priority  claims  to  the  international  application  and  the  provisional  application.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)(1).    (C)  is  not  correct  as  it  is  not  a  filing  date  for  any  application  in  this  question.
10856	(A)      Statement      1     	974	f	16.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.      The   principle   in   Statement   3,   that   consideration of inherent properties is part of proper consideration of the invention as a whole, is recited in MPEP § 2141.02, under the heading “Disclosed Inherent Properties Are Part Of ‘As A Whole’ Inquiry,” and in In re Antonie, 559 F.2d 618, 620, 195 USPQ 6, 8 (CCPA 1977).  (A) is incorrect,  because  the  proper  question  is  whether  the  invention  as  a  whole,  not  just  the  differences,  would  have  been  obvious.  See  MPEP  §  2141.02,  under  the  heading  “The  Claimed  Invention As A Whole Must Be Considered,” (citing Stratoflex, Inc. v. Aeroquip Corp., 713 F.2d 1530,  218  USPQ  871  (Fed.  Cir.  1983).    (B)  is  incorrect  because  an  examiner  should  consider  such  assertions  by  an  inventor  as  part  of  the  “subject  matter  as  a  whole.”  See  MPEP  §  2141.02  (citing In re Sponnoble, 405 F.2d 578, 585, 160 USPQ 237, 243 (CCPA 1969)).  (D) and (E) are incorrect because they include incorrect Statements 1 and/or 2.   
10851	(A)  The  national  stage  submission  was  proper  because  facsimile  transmission  is  a  valid method of correspondence in the USPTO. 	973	f	15.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.   37   §§   CFR   1.6(d)(3);   1.8(a)(2)(i)(F);   1.495(b);  MPEP  §  1893.01(a)(1),  2nd  paragraph.    The  filing  of  the  copy  of  the  international  application and the basic national fee in order to avoid abandonment under 37 CFR § 1.495(b), as  appropriate,  may  not  be  transmitted  by  facsimile.    See  37  CFR  §  1.6(d)(3)  and  37  CFR  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(F).    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  is  not  permitted  in  the  situations  set  forth  in  37  CFR  §  1.6(d).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  an  oath  or  declaration  may  be  submitted  by  facsimile  transmission  as  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  602,  the  national  stage  submission  was  improper  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  (C).    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  (C)  is  the  most  complete  answer.    Facsimile  transmissions  may  not  be  used  to  file  a  copy  of  the  international  application  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage.    (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  may  be  used to file certain correspondence in PCT applications.  See MPEP § 1805. 
10852	(B)  The  national  stage  submission  was  proper  because  a  copy  of  an  originally  executed  oath  or  declaration  is  acceptable,  but  the  original  oath  or  declaration  should be retained as evidence of authenticity. 	973	f	15.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.   37   §§   CFR   1.6(d)(3);   1.8(a)(2)(i)(F);   1.495(b);  MPEP  §  1893.01(a)(1),  2nd  paragraph.    The  filing  of  the  copy  of  the  international  application and the basic national fee in order to avoid abandonment under 37 CFR § 1.495(b), as  appropriate,  may  not  be  transmitted  by  facsimile.    See  37  CFR  §  1.6(d)(3)  and  37  CFR  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(F).    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  is  not  permitted  in  the  situations  set  forth  in  37  CFR  §  1.6(d).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  an  oath  or  declaration  may  be  submitted  by  facsimile  transmission  as  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  602,  the  national  stage  submission  was  improper  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  (C).    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  (C)  is  the  most  complete  answer.    Facsimile  transmissions  may  not  be  used  to  file  a  copy  of  the  international  application  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage.    (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  may  be  used to file certain correspondence in PCT applications.  See MPEP § 1805. 
10853	(C)  The  national  stage  submission  was  improper  because  a  copy  of  the  international  application  and  the  basic  national  fee  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage  as  required by 35 USC 371(c) may not be submitted by facsimile transmission. 	973	t	15.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.   37   §§   CFR   1.6(d)(3);   1.8(a)(2)(i)(F);   1.495(b);  MPEP  §  1893.01(a)(1),  2nd  paragraph.    The  filing  of  the  copy  of  the  international  application and the basic national fee in order to avoid abandonment under 37 CFR § 1.495(b), as  appropriate,  may  not  be  transmitted  by  facsimile.    See  37  CFR  §  1.6(d)(3)  and  37  CFR  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(F).    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  is  not  permitted  in  the  situations  set  forth  in  37  CFR  §  1.6(d).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  an  oath  or  declaration  may  be  submitted  by  facsimile  transmission  as  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  602,  the  national  stage  submission  was  improper  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  (C).    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  (C)  is  the  most  complete  answer.    Facsimile  transmissions  may  not  be  used  to  file  a  copy  of  the  international  application  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage.    (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  may  be  used to file certain correspondence in PCT applications.  See MPEP § 1805. 
10854	(D) The national stage submission was improper because the USPTO does not accept fee payments via facsimile transmission. 	973	f	15.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.   37   §§   CFR   1.6(d)(3);   1.8(a)(2)(i)(F);   1.495(b);  MPEP  §  1893.01(a)(1),  2nd  paragraph.    The  filing  of  the  copy  of  the  international  application and the basic national fee in order to avoid abandonment under 37 CFR § 1.495(b), as  appropriate,  may  not  be  transmitted  by  facsimile.    See  37  CFR  §  1.6(d)(3)  and  37  CFR  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(F).    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  is  not  permitted  in  the  situations  set  forth  in  37  CFR  §  1.6(d).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  an  oath  or  declaration  may  be  submitted  by  facsimile  transmission  as  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  602,  the  national  stage  submission  was  improper  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  (C).    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  (C)  is  the  most  complete  answer.    Facsimile  transmissions  may  not  be  used  to  file  a  copy  of  the  international  application  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage.    (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  may  be  used to file certain correspondence in PCT applications.  See MPEP § 1805. 
10855	(E) The national stage submission was improper because facsimile transmission may never be used for PCT applications. 	973	f	15.   ANSWER:    (C)   is   the   most   correct   answer.   37   §§   CFR   1.6(d)(3);   1.8(a)(2)(i)(F);   1.495(b);  MPEP  §  1893.01(a)(1),  2nd  paragraph.    The  filing  of  the  copy  of  the  international  application and the basic national fee in order to avoid abandonment under 37 CFR § 1.495(b), as  appropriate,  may  not  be  transmitted  by  facsimile.    See  37  CFR  §  1.6(d)(3)  and  37  CFR  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(F).    (A)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  is  not  permitted  in  the  situations  set  forth  in  37  CFR  §  1.6(d).    (B)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  an  oath  or  declaration  may  be  submitted  by  facsimile  transmission  as  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  602,  the  national  stage  submission  was  improper  for  the  reasons  discussed  in  (C).    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  (C)  is  the  most  complete  answer.    Facsimile  transmissions  may  not  be  used  to  file  a  copy  of  the  international  application  necessary  to  enter  the  national  stage.    (E)  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  facsimile  transmission  may  be  used to file certain correspondence in PCT applications.  See MPEP § 1805. 
10872	(B) The rationale to modify or combine the prior art references may be reasoned from knowledge  generally  available  to  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  established  scientific principles, or legal precedent established by prior case law. 	977	f	19.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2144.06,  under  the  heading  “Substituting  Equivalents  Known  For  The  Same  Purpose,”  states  “[i]n  order  to  rely  on  equivalence  as  a  rationale  supporting  an  obviousness  rejection,  the  equivalency  must  be  recognized in the prior art, and cannot be based on applicant's disclosure or the mere fact that the components  at  issue  are  functional  or  mechanical  equivalents.  In  re  Ruff,  256  F.2d  590,  118  USPQ  340  (CCPA  1958).”    (A)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144,  under  the  heading  “Rationale  Different  From  Applicant’s  Is  Permissible,”  states  “[t]he  reason  or  motivation  to  modify  the  reference may often suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different  problem.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  prior  art  suggest  the  combination  to  achieve  the  same  advantage  or  result  discovered  by  applicant.  In  re  Linter,  458  F.2d  1013,  173  USPQ  560  (CCPA 1972). . . ; In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 904 (1991). . . .” (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale May Be In A Reference, Or Reasoned From Common Knowledge In The Art, Scientific Principles, Art-Recognized  Equivalents,  Or  Legal  Precedent,”  states  “[t]he  rationale  to  modify  or  combine  the  prior  art  does  not  have  to  be  expressly  stated  in  the  prior  art;  the  rationale  may  be  expressly  or  impliedly contained in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, established scientific principles, or legal precedent established by prior  case  law.  In  re  Fine,  837  F.2d  1071,  5  USPQ2d  1596  (Fed.  Cir.  1988);  In  re  Jones,  958  F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also . . . In re Nilssen, 851 F.2d 1401, 1403, 7 USPQ2d  1500,  1502  (Fed.  Cir.  1988)  (references  do  not  have  to  explicitly  suggest  combining  teachings).”   (C)   is   incorrect.      MPEP   §   2144.01,   quotes   In   re   Preda,   401 F.2d 825, 159 USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968) as stating “[i]n considering the disclosure of a reference, it is proper  to  take  into  account  not  only  specific  teachings  of  the  reference  but  also  the  inferences  which one skilled in the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom.” (D) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144.03  under  the  heading  “A.  Determine  When  It  Is  Appropriate  To  Take  Official  Notice   Without   Documentary   Evidence   To   Support   The   Examiner’s   Conclusion,”   states   “[o]fficial   notice   without   documentary   evidence   to   support   an   examiner’s   conclusion   is   permissible  only  in  some  circumstances.  .  .  .    Official  notice  unsupported  by  documentary  evidence should only be taken by the examiner where the facts asserted to be well-known, or to be  common  knowledge  in  the  art  are  capable  of  instant  and  unquestionable  demonstration  as  being well-known.  As noted by the court in In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091, 165 USPQ 418, 420  (CCPA  1970),  the  notice  of  facts  beyond  the  record  which  may  be  taken  by  the  examiner  must be ‘capable of such instant and unquestionable demonstration as to defy dispute (citing In re Knapp Monarch Co., 296 F.2d 230, 132 USPQ 6 (CCPA 1961).”
10873	(C)  In  considering  the  disclosure  of  the  prior  art  references,  it  is  proper  to  take  into  account the specific teachings of the references, as well as the inferences that one skilled in the art could reasonably draw from the specific teachings.	977	f	19.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2144.06,  under  the  heading  “Substituting  Equivalents  Known  For  The  Same  Purpose,”  states  “[i]n  order  to  rely  on  equivalence  as  a  rationale  supporting  an  obviousness  rejection,  the  equivalency  must  be  recognized in the prior art, and cannot be based on applicant's disclosure or the mere fact that the components  at  issue  are  functional  or  mechanical  equivalents.  In  re  Ruff,  256  F.2d  590,  118  USPQ  340  (CCPA  1958).”    (A)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144,  under  the  heading  “Rationale  Different  From  Applicant’s  Is  Permissible,”  states  “[t]he  reason  or  motivation  to  modify  the  reference may often suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different  problem.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  prior  art  suggest  the  combination  to  achieve  the  same  advantage  or  result  discovered  by  applicant.

MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale May Be In A Reference, Or Reasoned From Common Knowledge In The Art, Scientific Principles, Art-Recognized  Equivalents,  Or  Legal  Precedent,”  states  “[t]he  rationale  to  modify  or  combine  the  prior  art  does  not  have  to  be  expressly  stated  in  the  prior  art;  the  rationale  may  be  expressly  or  impliedly contained in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, established scientific principles, or legal precedent established by prior  case  law.  In  re  Fine,  837  F.2d  1071,  5  USPQ2d  1596  (Fed.  Cir.  1988);  In  re  Jones,  958  F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also . . .

MPEP   §   2144.01,   quotes   In   re   Preda,   401 F.2d 825, 159 USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968) as stating “[i]n considering the disclosure of a reference, it is proper  to  take  into  account  not  only  specific  teachings  of  the  reference  but  also  the  inferences  which one skilled in the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom.” (D) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144.03  under  the  heading  “A.  Determine  When  It  Is  Appropriate  To  Take  Official  Notice   Without   Documentary   Evidence   To   Support   The   Examiner’s   Conclusion,”   states   “[o]fficial   notice   without   documentary   evidence   to   support   an   examiner’s   conclusion   is   permissible  only  in  some  circumstances.  .  .  .    Official  notice  unsupported  by  documentary  evidence should only be taken by the examiner where the facts asserted to be well-known, or to be  common  knowledge  in  the  art  are  capable  of  instant  and  unquestionable  demonstration  as  being well-known.

The   principle   in   Statement   3,   that   consideration of inherent properties is part of proper consideration of the invention as a whole, is recited in MPEP § 2141.02, under the heading “Disclosed Inherent Properties Are Part Of ‘As A Whole’ Inquiry,” and in In re Antonie, 559 F.2d 618, 620, 195 USPQ 6, 8 (CCPA 1977).  (A) is incorrect,  because  the  proper  question  is  whether  the  invention  as  a  whole,  not  just  the  differences,  would  have  been  obvious.

10861	(A)  A  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  under  PCT  Article  21(2),  which  has  an  international  filing  date  of  October  3,  2000,  was  published  in  English and designated the United States. 	975	f	17.  ANSWER:    The  correct  answer  is  answer  (C).    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  706.02(f).    The application publication is a proper reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) because it was filed by another  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  the  invention.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)  et  seq.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  reference  in  answer  (A)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  its  international  filing  date  was  prior  to  November  29,  2000  thereby  failing  one  of  the  three  conditions  for  a  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  to  be  applied  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  §  706(f)(1),  under  the  heading  “I.  Determine  The  Appropriate  35  U.S.C. 102(e) For Each Potential Reference By Following The Guidelines, Examples And Flow Charts Set Forth Below,” subpart (C), which states “[I]f the potential reference resulted from, or claimed the benefit of, an international application, the following must be determined:  (1) If the international application meets the following three conditions: (a) an international filing date on or after November 29, 2000 . . . then the international filing date is a U.S. filing date for prior art purposes  under  35  U.S.C.  102(e).”    The  reference  in  (B)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C. § 102(e) because the reference is not by another.  See MPEP § 706.02(f).  The reference in  (D)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  refers  to  patents and patent applications, not journal articles.  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
10874	(D) An examiner may take official notice of facts outside the record that are capable of  instant  and  unquestionable  demonstration  as  being  “well  known”  prior  art  or  common knowledge in the art.	977	f	19.

10875	(E)  To  rely  on  equivalence  as  a  rationale  supporting  an  obviousness  rejection  under  35  USC  103  an  examiner  may  base  the  rejection  on  the  mere  fact  that  the  components at issue are functional or mechanical equivalents.	977	t	19.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2144.06,  under  the  heading  “Substituting  Equivalents  Known  For  The  Same  Purpose,”  states  “[i]n  order  to  rely  on  equivalence  as  a  rationale  supporting  an  obviousness  rejection,  the  equivalency  must  be  recognized in the prior art, and cannot be based on applicant's disclosure or the mere fact that the components  at  issue  are  functional  or  mechanical  equivalents.

11136	(A)In return for a patent, the inventor gives a complete disclosure of the invention for which protection is sought. 	1030	f	22.   ANSWER:  (E)  is  incorrect  as  a  preliminary  amendment  may  be  filed  with  the  original  disclosure  and  will  be  treated  as  part  of  the  original  disclosure  in  accordance  with  MPEP  § 608.04(b)  (A) through (D) are all correct.  See MPEP § 608 at p. 600-53.
11567	(D)I and III	1116	t	6. ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer. MPEP § 706.07(b). In both I and III the finality is improper. MPEP § 706.07(b). Therefore (A) and (C) are incorrect. In II the finality is proper. MPEP § 706.07(b). Therefore (B) and (E) are incorrect.
10862	(B) A U.S. patent by J.J. Smithy that has a filing date of September 5, 2000. 	975	f	17.  ANSWER:    The  correct  answer  is  answer  (C).    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  706.02(f).    The application publication is a proper reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) because it was filed by another  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  the  invention.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)  et  seq.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  reference  in  answer  (A)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  its  international  filing  date  was  prior  to  November  29,  2000  thereby  failing  one  of  the  three  conditions  for  a  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  to  be  applied  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  §  706(f)(1),  under  the  heading  “I.  Determine  The  Appropriate  35  U.S.C. 102(e) For Each Potential Reference By Following The Guidelines, Examples And Flow Charts Set Forth Below,” subpart (C), which states “[I]f the potential reference resulted from, or claimed the benefit of, an international application, the following must be determined:  (1) If the international application meets the following three conditions: (a) an international filing date on or after November 29, 2000 . . . then the international filing date is a U.S. filing date for prior art purposes  under  35  U.S.C.  102(e).”    The  reference  in  (B)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C. § 102(e) because the reference is not by another.  See MPEP § 706.02(f).  The reference in  (D)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  refers  to  patents and patent applications, not journal articles.  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
10863	(C) A U.S. application publication under 35 U.S.C. 122(b) by inventor Jones that was filed on August 8, 2000. 	975	t	17.  ANSWER:    The  correct  answer  is  answer  (C).    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  706.02(f).    The application publication is a proper reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) because it was filed by another  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  the  invention.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)  et  seq.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  reference  in  answer  (A)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  its  international  filing  date  was  prior  to  November  29,  2000  thereby  failing  one  of  the  three  conditions  for  a  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  to  be  applied  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  §  706(f)(1),  under  the  heading  “I.  Determine  The  Appropriate  35  U.S.C. 102(e) For Each Potential Reference By Following The Guidelines, Examples And Flow Charts Set Forth Below,” subpart (C), which states “[I]f the potential reference resulted from, or claimed the benefit of, an international application, the following must be determined:  (1) If the international application meets the following three conditions: (a) an international filing date on or after November 29, 2000 . . . then the international filing date is a U.S. filing date for prior art purposes  under  35  U.S.C.  102(e).”    The  reference  in  (B)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C. § 102(e) because the reference is not by another.  See MPEP § 706.02(f).  The reference in  (D)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  refers  to  patents and patent applications, not journal articles.  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
10864	(D) A journal article by Marks published on October 11, 2000.	975	f	17.  ANSWER:    The  correct  answer  is  answer  (C).    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  706.02(f).    The application publication is a proper reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) because it was filed by another  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  the  invention.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)  et  seq.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  reference  in  answer  (A)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  its  international  filing  date  was  prior  to  November  29,  2000  thereby  failing  one  of  the  three  conditions  for  a  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  to  be  applied  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  §  706(f)(1),  under  the  heading  “I.  Determine  The  Appropriate  35  U.S.C. 102(e) For Each Potential Reference By Following The Guidelines, Examples And Flow Charts Set Forth Below,” subpart (C), which states “[I]f the potential reference resulted from, or claimed the benefit of, an international application, the following must be determined:  (1) If the international application meets the following three conditions: (a) an international filing date on or after November 29, 2000 . . . then the international filing date is a U.S. filing date for prior art purposes  under  35  U.S.C.  102(e).”    The  reference  in  (B)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C. § 102(e) because the reference is not by another.  See MPEP § 706.02(f).  The reference in  (D)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  refers  to  patents and patent applications, not journal articles.  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
10865	(E) All of the above.	975	f	17.  ANSWER:    The  correct  answer  is  answer  (C).    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  706.02(f).    The application publication is a proper reference under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) because it was filed by another  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  the  invention.    See  MPEP  §  706.02(f)  et  seq.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect.  The  reference  in  answer  (A)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  its  international  filing  date  was  prior  to  November  29,  2000  thereby  failing  one  of  the  three  conditions  for  a  WIPO  publication  of  an  international  application  to  be  applied  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e).    See  MPEP  §  706(f)(1),  under  the  heading  “I.

See MPEP § 706.02(f).  The reference in  (D)  is  not  a  proper  reference  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  because  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  refers  to  patents and patent applications, not journal articles.  See MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (E) is not correct because (C) is correct and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11137	(B)  Amendments  filed  after  the  filing  date  that  lack  descriptive  basis  in  the  original  disclosure involve new matter. 	1030	f	22.   ANSWER:  (E)  is  incorrect  as  a  preliminary  amendment  may  be  filed  with  the  original  disclosure  and  will  be  treated  as  part  of  the  original  disclosure  in  accordance  with  MPEP  § 608.04(b)  (A) through (D) are all correct.  See MPEP § 608 at p. 600-53.
11850	(B) The petition is supported by applicant’s unverified statement that applicant’s age is 65.	1181	t	see MPEP 708.02
10866	(A)       The   practitioner   should   file   a   request   under   37   CFR   1.48   to   correct   the   inventorship of the application with a new declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 signed by John Jones (with the correct spelling of this name), a statement by Mr. Jones as to how the error occurred and that the error was without deceptive intention, and the processing fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(q). 	976	f	18.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  605.04(b),  which  states  “Except  for  correction  of  a  typographical  or  transliteration  error  in  the  spelling  of  an  inventor's  name,  a  request  to  have  the  name  changed  to  the  signed  version  or  any  other  corrections  in  the  name of the inventor(s) will not be entertained...When a typographical or transliteration error in the spelling of an inventor's name is discovered during pendency of an application, a petition is not required, nor is a new oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 needed. The U.S.[PTO] should simply  be  notified  of  the  error  and  reference  to  the  notification  paper  will  be  made  on  the  previously filed oath or declaration by the Office.”  (A), (B) and (D) could result in the spelling of Jon’s name being corrected in USPTO records, but would do so at a higher cost to applicant, and therefore neither one is the most correct answer.  Furthermore, (A) is also not correct in that if a request to add John Jones as an inventor was to be filed, another request (and fee) to delete Jon  Jones  would  be  required.    (B)  is  wrong  because  a  petition  under  37  CFR  §  1.182  is  not  required if the error in the name is a typographical error, and the facts specify that the error in the spelling of “John” as “Jon” is a typographical error.  (D) is not correct because not only would filing a continuation create an additional expensive, but filing a new application could also delay examination.  (E) is not correct because pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.2, business with the Office is to be  conducted  in  writing,  and,  even  more  importantly,  because  “it  is  improper  for  anyone,  including counsel, to alter, rewrite, or partly fill in any part of the application, including the oath or declaration, after execution of the oath or declaration by the applicant.” MPEP § 605.04(a).
10867	(B) The practitioner should file a petition under 37 CFR 1.182 and the petition fee set forth  in  37  CFR  1.17(h),  requesting  correction  of  the  spelling  of  the  inventor’s  name.  	976	f	18.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  605.04(b),  which  states  “Except  for  correction  of  a  typographical  or  transliteration  error  in  the  spelling  of  an  inventor's  name,  a  request  to  have  the  name  changed  to  the  signed  version  or  any  other  corrections  in  the  name of the inventor(s) will not be entertained...When a typographical or transliteration error in the spelling of an inventor's name is discovered during pendency of an application, a petition is not required, nor is a new oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 needed.

Furthermore, (A) is also not correct in that if a request to add John Jones as an inventor was to be filed, another request (and fee) to delete Jon  Jones  would  be  required.    (B)  is  wrong  because  a  petition  under  37  CFR  §  1.182  is  not  required if the error in the name is a typographical error, and the facts specify that the error in the spelling of “John” as “Jon” is a typographical error.  (D) is not correct because not only would filing a continuation create an additional expensive, but filing a new application could also delay examination.

10868	(C) The practitioner should file a request for a corrected filing receipt and a separate letter to the Office explaining that the declaration contains a typographical error, that  the  correct  spelling  of  the  inventor’s  name  is  John  Jones,  and  requesting  correction of the Office records.	976	t	18.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  605.04(b),  which  states  “Except  for  correction  of  a  typographical  or  transliteration  error  in  the  spelling  of  an  inventor's  name,  a  request  to  have  the  name  changed  to  the  signed  version  or  any  other  corrections  in  the  name of the inventor(s) will not be entertained...When a typographical or transliteration error in the spelling of an inventor's name is discovered during pendency of an application, a petition is not required, nor is a new oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 needed.

10869	(D) The practitioner should expressly abandon the application, and file a continuation with a new declaration with the correct spelling.	976	f	18.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  605.04(b),  which  states  “Except  for  correction  of  a  typographical  or  transliteration  error  in  the  spelling  of  an  inventor's  name,  a  request  to  have  the  name  changed  to  the  signed  version  or  any  other  corrections  in  the  name of the inventor(s) will not be entertained...When a typographical or transliteration error in the spelling of an inventor's name is discovered during pendency of an application, a petition is not required, nor is a new oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 needed.

10870	(E) The practitioner should call the examiner and tell the examiner that the inventor’s name is wrong, and ask for the examiner to change the name on the declaration. 	976	f	18.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  MPEP  §  605.04(b),  which  states  “Except  for  correction  of  a  typographical  or  transliteration  error  in  the  spelling  of  an  inventor's  name,  a  request  to  have  the  name  changed  to  the  signed  version  or  any  other  corrections  in  the  name of the inventor(s) will not be entertained...When a typographical or transliteration error in the spelling of an inventor's name is discovered during pendency of an application, a petition is not required, nor is a new oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 needed.

10871	(A)  Where  the  combination  of  prior  art  references  provides  motivation  to  make  the  claimed  invention  to  achieve  the  same  advantage  or  result  discovered  by  the  applicant,  the  references  do  not  have  to  expressly  suggest  the  combination  of  references.	977	f	19.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2144.06,  under  the  heading  “Substituting  Equivalents  Known  For  The  Same  Purpose,”  states  “[i]n  order  to  rely  on  equivalence  as  a  rationale  supporting  an  obviousness  rejection,  the  equivalency  must  be  recognized in the prior art, and cannot be based on applicant's disclosure or the mere fact that the components  at  issue  are  functional  or  mechanical  equivalents.  In  re  Ruff,  256  F.2d  590,  118  USPQ  340  (CCPA  1958).”    (A)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144,  under  the  heading  “Rationale  Different  From  Applicant’s  Is  Permissible,”  states  “[t]he  reason  or  motivation  to  modify  the  reference may often suggest what the inventor has done, but for a different purpose or to solve a different  problem.  It  is  not  necessary  that  the  prior  art  suggest  the  combination  to  achieve  the  same  advantage  or  result  discovered  by  applicant.  In  re  Linter,  458  F.2d  1013,  173  USPQ  560  (CCPA 1972). . . ; In re Dillon, 919 F.2d 688, 16 USPQ2d 1897 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 904 (1991). . . .” (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2144, under the heading “Rationale May Be In A Reference, Or Reasoned From Common Knowledge In The Art, Scientific Principles, Art-Recognized  Equivalents,  Or  Legal  Precedent,”  states  “[t]he  rationale  to  modify  or  combine  the  prior  art  does  not  have  to  be  expressly  stated  in  the  prior  art;  the  rationale  may  be  expressly  or  impliedly contained in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, established scientific principles, or legal precedent established by prior  case  law.  In  re  Fine,  837  F.2d  1071,  5  USPQ2d  1596  (Fed.  Cir.  1988);  In  re  Jones,  958  F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See also . . . In re Nilssen, 851 F.2d 1401, 1403, 7 USPQ2d  1500,  1502  (Fed.  Cir.  1988)  (references  do  not  have  to  explicitly  suggest  combining  teachings).”   (C)   is   incorrect.      MPEP   §   2144.01,   quotes   In   re   Preda,   401 F.2d 825, 159 USPQ 342, 344 (CCPA 1968) as stating “[i]n considering the disclosure of a reference, it is proper  to  take  into  account  not  only  specific  teachings  of  the  reference  but  also  the  inferences  which one skilled in the art would reasonably be expected to draw therefrom.” (D) is incorrect.  MPEP  §  2144.03  under  the  heading  “A.  Determine  When  It  Is  Appropriate  To  Take  Official  Notice   Without   Documentary   Evidence   To   Support   The   Examiner’s   Conclusion,”   states   “[o]fficial   notice   without   documentary   evidence   to   support   an   examiner’s   conclusion   is   permissible  only  in  some  circumstances.  .  .  .    Official  notice  unsupported  by  documentary  evidence should only be taken by the examiner where the facts asserted to be well-known, or to be  common  knowledge  in  the  art  are  capable  of  instant  and  unquestionable  demonstration  as  being well-known.  As noted by the court in In re Ahlert, 424 F.2d 1088, 1091, 165 USPQ 418, 420  (CCPA  1970),  the  notice  of  facts  beyond  the  record  which  may  be  taken  by  the  examiner  must be ‘capable of such instant and unquestionable demonstration as to defy dispute (citing In re Knapp Monarch Co., 296 F.2d 230, 132 USPQ 6 (CCPA 1961).”
10876	(A)  A  rejection  under  35  USC  102(a)  based  on  an  affidavit  that  the  invention  was  known or used by others before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent. 	978	f	20.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  302;  37  CFR  §  1.552;  and  MPEP § 2258.  MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Prior Patents Or Printed Publications,” states “[r]ejections  on  prior  art  in  reexamination  proceedings  may  only  be  made  on  the  basis  of  prior  patents or printed publications. Prior art rejections may be based upon the following portions of 35  U.S.C.  102:  .  .  .(e).”    (A),  (B),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2258,  under  the  heading  “Matters  Other  Than  Patents  or  Printed  Publications,”  states  “[r]ejections  will  not  be  based  on  matters  other  than  patents  or  printed  publications,  such  as  public  use  or  sale,  inventorship,  35  U.S.C.  101,  fraud,  etc.  In  this  regard,  see  In  re  Lanham,  1  USPQ2d  1877  (Comm'r  Pat.  1986),  and Stewart Systems v. Comm'r of Patents and Trademarks, 1 USPQ2d 1879 (E.D. Va. 1986). A rejection  on  prior  public  use  or  sale,  insufficiency  of  disclosure,  etc.,  cannot  be  made  even  if  it  relies  on  a  prior  patent  or  printed  publication.  Prior  patents  or  printed  publications  must  be  applied  under  an  appropriate  portion  of  35  U.S.C.  102  and/or  103  when  making  a  rejection.”  Reexamination  is  limited  to  substantially  new  questions  of  patentability  based  on  patents  and  publications. 
10877	(B) A rejection under 35 USC 102(b) based on an affidavit that the invention was in the  public  use  in  this  country  more  than  one  year  prior  to  the  date  of  the  application for a patent in the United States.	978	f	20.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  302;  37  CFR  §  1.552;  and  MPEP § 2258.  MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Prior Patents Or Printed Publications,” states “[r]ejections  on  prior  art  in  reexamination  proceedings  may  only  be  made  on  the  basis  of  prior  patents or printed publications.

10878	(C) A rejection under 35 USC 102(e) that the invention was described in a patent by another  filed  in  the  United  States  before  the  invention  thereof  by  the  patent  applicant. 	978	t	20.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  302;  37  CFR  §  1.552;  and  MPEP § 2258.  MPEP § 2258, under the heading “Prior Patents Or Printed Publications,” states “[r]ejections  on  prior  art  in  reexamination  proceedings  may  only  be  made  on  the  basis  of  prior  patents or printed publications. Prior art rejections may be based upon the following portions of 35  U.S.C.  102:  .  .  .(e).”    (A),  (B),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2258,  under  the  heading  “Matters  Other  Than  Patents  or  Printed  Publications,”  states  “[r]ejections  will  not  be  based  on  matters  other  than  patents  or  printed  publications,  such  as  public  use  or  sale,  inventorship,  35  U.S.C.  101,  fraud,  etc.  In  this  regard,  see  In  re  Lanham,  1  USPQ2d  1877  (Comm'r  Pat.  1986),  and Stewart Systems v. Comm'r of Patents and Trademarks, 1 USPQ2d 1879 (E.D. Va. 1986). A rejection  on  prior  public  use  or  sale,  insufficiency  of  disclosure,  etc.,  cannot  be  made  even  if  it  relies  on  a  prior  patent  or  printed  publication.  Prior  patents  or  printed  publications  must  be  applied  under  an  appropriate  portion  of  35  U.S.C.  102  and/or  103  when  making  a  rejection.”  Reexamination  is  limited  to  substantially  new  questions  of  patentability  based  on  patents  and  publications. 
10879	(D)  A  rejection  under  35  USC  102(f)  based  on  an  affidavit  that  the  applicant  did  not  himself invent the subject matter sought to be patented.	978	f	20.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  302;  37  CFR  §  1.552;  and  MPEP § 2258.

10884	(D)  A  timely  filed  and  properly  signed  written  request  for  continued  examination  (RCE). 	979	f	21. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.111; MPEP § 714.02.  Section 1.111 states in pertinent part: “(a)(1) If the Office action after the first examination (§ 1.104) is adverse in any respect, the applicant or patent owner, ... must reply and request reconsideration or   further   examination,   with   or   without   amendment.   ...   (b)   In   order   to   be   entitled   to   reconsideration  or  further  examination,  the  applicant  or  patent  owner  must  reply  to  the  Office  action.  The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be reduced to a writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors in the examiner’s action and must reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the prior Office action.  The reply must present arguments pointing  out  the  specific  distinctions  believed  to  render  the  claims,  including  any  newly  presented  claims,  patentable  over  any  applied  references.  ...The  applicant’s  or  patent  owner’s  reply  must  appear  throughout  to  be  a  bona  fide  attempt  to  advance  the  application  or  the  reexamination proceeding to final action.  A general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention   without   specifically   pointing   out   how   the   language   of   the   claims   patentably   distinguishes  them  from  the  references  does  not  comply  with  the  requirements  of  this  section.”    MPEP  §  714.02  states  “In  all  cases  where  reply  to  a  requirement  is  indicated  as  necessary  to  further  consideration  of  the  claims  ...  a  complete  reply  must  either  comply  with  the  formal  requirements or specifically traverse each one not complied with.”  (B) and (C) are not the most correct  answers.    37  CFR  §  1.111;  MPEP  §§  714.02  and  714.04.    Neither  reply  specifically  points  out  the  supposed  errors  in  the  examiner’s  action  and  neither  reply  present  arguments  pointing  out  how  the  newly  presented  claims  overcome  the  rejections.    (D)  is  not  the  most  correct answer.  See 37 CFR § 1.114.  A request for continued examination can only be made if prosecution  of  an  application  is  closed.    In  this  question  the  Office  action  is  a  non-final  office  action.  (E) is not the most correct answer since (A) is correct and (B), (D) and (D) are incorrect. 
10880	(E)  A  rejection  under  35  USC  102(b)  that  the  invention  was  on  sale  in  this  country,  more  than  one  year  prior  to  the  date  of  the  application  for  patent  in  the  United  States. 	978	f	20.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  302;  37  CFR  §  1.552;  and  MPEP § 2258.

10882	(B)  A  timely  filed  and  properly  signed  written  reply  which  includes  an  amendment  canceling  all  the  claims  in  the  application  and  adding  new  claims,  and  a  request  for  the  examiner’s  rejections  to  be  reconsidered  in  view  of  the  newly  presented  claims.	979	f	21. ANSWER:   (A) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.111; MPEP § 714.02.

10886	(A)  Where  an  inventor's  residence  is  stated  correctly  in  the  37  CFR  1.76  application  data  sheet  and  incorrectly  in  the  inventor's  37  CFR  1.63  oath  or  declaration,  the  discrepancy  must  be  corrected  by  filing  a  supplemental  37  CFR  1.67  oath  or  declaration giving the correct residence.	980	f	22.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    (A)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures as related in the MPEP.  Regarding (A), MPEP § 601.05, states (“[i]f an application is filed with an application data sheet correctly setting forth the citizenship of inventor B, and an executed 37 CFR 1.63 declaration setting forth a different incorrect citizenship of inventor B, the Office will capture the citizenship of inventor B found in the application data sheet.  Applicant, however,  must  submit  a  supplemental  oath  or  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.67  by  inventor  B  setting forth the correct citizenship even though it appears correctly in the application data sheet. ...  If, however, the error is one of residence, no change would be required (37 CFR 1.76(d)(2)).”  (B)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP.    As  for  (B),  MPEP  §  602,  under  the  heading    “Sole  Or  Joint  Designation,”  states  “[w]hen  joint  inventors  execute separate oaths or declarations, each oath or declaration should make reference to the fact that  the  affiant  is  a  joint  inventor  together  with  each  of  the  other  inventors  indicating  them  by  name.”    The  examiner  should  notify  the  inventors  that  their  oaths  or  declarations  are  defective  and  that  new  oaths  or  declarations  are  required.    (C)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  the  heading “II. Treatment Of Improper Dependent Claims,” states “[c]laims which are in improper dependent  form  for  failing  to  further  limit  the  subject  matter  of  a  previous  claim  should  be  objected  to  under  37  CFR  1.75(c)  by  using  form  paragraph  7.36.”    The  claim  should  not  be  rejected.    Further  as  for  (C),  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  heading  “III.  Infringement  Test,”  states  “[a]  dependent  claim  does  not  lack  compliance  with  35  U.S.C.  112,  fourth  paragraph,  simply  because  there  is  a  question  as  to  (1)  the  significance  of  the  further  limitation  added  by  the  dependent claim, or (2) whether the further limitation in fact changes the scope of the dependent claim from that of the claim from which it depends.  The test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.  The test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.”  (D)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP.    As  for  (D),  MPEP § 609, under heading “(B)(5) Statement Under 37 CFR 1.97(e),” states “[t]he date on the communication by the foreign patent office begins the 3-month period in the same manner as the mailing  of  an  Office  action  starts  a  3-month  shortened  statutory  period  for  reply  .  ...    The  date  which  begins  the  3-month  period  is  not  the  date  the  communication  was  received  by  a  foreign  associate or the date it was received by a U.S. registered practitioner.” 
10887	(B) Where two inventors file separate 37 CFR 1.63 oaths or declarations which do not identify both inventors, the USPTO will presume they are joint inventors and will not require new oaths or declarations. 	980	f	22.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    (A)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures as related in the MPEP.  Regarding (A), MPEP § 601.05, states (“[i]f an application is filed with an application data sheet correctly setting forth the citizenship of inventor B, and an executed 37 CFR 1.63 declaration setting forth a different incorrect citizenship of inventor B, the Office will capture the citizenship of inventor B found in the application data sheet.

Further  as  for  (C),  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  heading  “III.

As  for  (D),  MPEP § 609, under heading “(B)(5) Statement Under 37 CFR 1.97(e),” states “[t]he date on the communication by the foreign patent office begins the 3-month period in the same manner as the mailing  of  an  Office  action  starts  a  3-month  shortened  statutory  period  for  reply  .  ...    The  date  which  begins  the  3-month  period  is  not  the  date  the  communication  was  received  by  a  foreign  associate or the date it was received by a U.S. registered practitioner.” 
10888	(C) A dependent claim which merely repeats a limitation that appears in the claim on which it depends is properly rejected under the fourth paragraph of 35 USC 112.	980	f	22.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    (A)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures as related in the MPEP.  Regarding (A), MPEP § 601.05, states (“[i]f an application is filed with an application data sheet correctly setting forth the citizenship of inventor B, and an executed 37 CFR 1.63 declaration setting forth a different incorrect citizenship of inventor B, the Office will capture the citizenship of inventor B found in the application data sheet.  Applicant, however,  must  submit  a  supplemental  oath  or  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.67  by  inventor  B  setting forth the correct citizenship even though it appears correctly in the application data sheet. ...  If, however, the error is one of residence, no change would be required (37 CFR 1.76(d)(2)).”  (B)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP.    As  for  (B),  MPEP  §  602,  under  the  heading    “Sole  Or  Joint  Designation,”  states  “[w]hen  joint  inventors  execute separate oaths or declarations, each oath or declaration should make reference to the fact that  the  affiant  is  a  joint  inventor  together  with  each  of  the  other  inventors  indicating  them  by  name.”    The  examiner  should  notify  the  inventors  that  their  oaths  or  declarations  are  defective  and  that  new  oaths  or  declarations  are  required.    (C)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  the  heading “II. Treatment Of Improper Dependent Claims,” states “[c]laims which are in improper dependent  form  for  failing  to  further  limit  the  subject  matter  of  a  previous  claim  should  be  objected  to  under  37  CFR  1.75(c)  by  using  form  paragraph  7.36.”    The  claim  should  not  be  rejected.    Further  as  for  (C),  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  heading  “III.  Infringement  Test,”  states  “[a]  dependent  claim  does  not  lack  compliance  with  35  U.S.C.  112,  fourth  paragraph,  simply  because  there  is  a  question  as  to  (1)  the  significance  of  the  further  limitation  added  by  the  dependent claim, or (2) whether the further limitation in fact changes the scope of the dependent claim from that of the claim from which it depends.  The test for a proper dependent claim under the fourth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. 112 is whether the dependent claim includes every limitation of the claim from which it depends.  The test is not one of whether the claims differ in scope.”  (D)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP.    As  for  (D),  MPEP § 609, under heading “(B)(5) Statement Under 37 CFR 1.97(e),” states “[t]he date on the communication by the foreign patent office begins the 3-month period in the same manner as the mailing  of  an  Office  action  starts  a  3-month  shortened  statutory  period  for  reply  .  ...    The  date  which  begins  the  3-month  period  is  not  the  date  the  communication  was  received  by  a  foreign  associate or the date it was received by a U.S. registered practitioner.” 
10889	(D) In a statement under 37 CFR 1.97(e)(1) specifying that “each item of information contained   in   the   information   disclosure   statement   was   first   cited   in   any   communication  from  a  foreign  patent  office  in  a  counterpart  foreign  application  not more than three months prior to the filing of the statement,” the three-month period begins on the date the communication was first received by either a foreign associate or a U.S. registered practitioner.	980	f	22.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    (A)  is  not  in  accord  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures as related in the MPEP.  Regarding (A), MPEP § 601.05, states (“[i]f an application is filed with an application data sheet correctly setting forth the citizenship of inventor B, and an executed 37 CFR 1.63 declaration setting forth a different incorrect citizenship of inventor B, the Office will capture the citizenship of inventor B found in the application data sheet.

As  for  (B),  MPEP  §  602,  under  the  heading    “Sole  Or  Joint  Designation,”  states  “[w]hen  joint  inventors  execute separate oaths or declarations, each oath or declaration should make reference to the fact that  the  affiant  is  a  joint  inventor  together  with  each  of  the  other  inventors  indicating  them  by  name.”    The  examiner  should  notify  the  inventors  that  their  oaths  or  declarations  are  defective  and  that  new  oaths  or  declarations  are  required.    (C)  is  incorrect.  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  the  heading “II. Treatment Of Improper Dependent Claims,” states “[c]laims which are in improper dependent  form  for  failing  to  further  limit  the  subject  matter  of  a  previous  claim  should  be  objected  to  under  37  CFR  1.75(c)  by  using  form  paragraph  7.36.”    The  claim  should  not  be  rejected.    Further  as  for  (C),  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  under  heading  “III.

As  for  (D),  MPEP § 609, under heading “(B)(5) Statement Under 37 CFR 1.97(e),” states “[t]he date on the communication by the foreign patent office begins the 3-month period in the same manner as the mailing  of  an  Office  action  starts  a  3-month  shortened  statutory  period  for  reply  .  ...    The  date  which  begins  the  3-month  period  is  not  the  date  the  communication  was  received  by  a  foreign  associate or the date it was received by a U.S. registered practitioner.” 
10890	(E) None of statements (A) to (D) is correct.	980	t	22.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  correct  answer.

10891	(A)  Reject  claim  1  under  35  USC  103,  based  on  the  abstract,  because  it  is  a  publication in its own right and provides sufficient basis for a prima facie case of obviousness. 	981	t	23.  ANSWER:   (A)  or  (D)  is  accepted  as  correct.    As  to  (A),  MPEP  §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection  in  a  non-final  Office  action  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  abstract  only  without  relying  on  the  full  text  document.”    In  the  facts,  the  “published  abstract  provides  an  adequate  basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.”  As to (D) MPEP §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  states  “[c]itation  of  and  reliance  upon  an  abstract  without  citation  of  and  reliance  upon  the  underlying  scientific  document  is  generally  inappropriate  where  both  the  abstract and the underlying document are prior art.  See Ex parte Jones, 62 USPQ2d 1206, 1208 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 2001) (unpublished).”  (B) is incorrect.  MPEP § 706.02, under the heading “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  indicates  that  documents  that  are  not  in  English  can  form  the  basis  of  a  prior  art  rejection,  although they must be translated first in order to make clear the facts that the examiner is relying on.  (C) is incorrect.  MPEP § 706.02, under the heading “Reliance Upon Abstracts And Foreign Language Documents In Support Of A Rejection,” states “[w]hen an abstract is used to support a rejection, the evidence relied upon is the facts contained in the abstract, not additional facts that may  be  contained  in  the  underlying  full-text  document.”  (E)  is  incorrect.    See,  e.g.,  MPEP  § 2121.01.  Whether a disclosure is enabling is a fact-dependent determination that must be made on  a  case-by-case  basis.    Even  pictures  may  constitute  an  enabling  disclosure  in  some  cases  (MPEP § 2121.04).
10892	(B) Reject claim 1 under 35 USC 103, based on the abstract, because disclosures that are not in English cannot form the basis of a prior art rejection. 	981	f	23.  ANSWER:   (A)  or  (D)  is  accepted  as  correct.    As  to  (A),  MPEP  §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection  in  a  non-final  Office  action  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  abstract  only  without  relying  on  the  full  text  document.”    In  the  facts,  the  “published  abstract  provides  an  adequate  basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.”  As to (D) MPEP §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  states  “[c]itation  of  and  reliance  upon  an  abstract  without  citation  of  and  reliance  upon  the  underlying  scientific  document  is  generally  inappropriate  where  both  the  abstract and the underlying document are prior art.

10893	(C)  Reject  claim  1  under  35  USC  103,  based  on  the  German-language  patent  document, as evidenced by the abstract. 	981	f	23.  ANSWER:   (A)  or  (D)  is  accepted  as  correct.    As  to  (A),  MPEP  §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection  in  a  non-final  Office  action  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  abstract  only  without  relying  on  the  full  text  document.”    In  the  facts,  the  “published  abstract  provides  an  adequate  basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.”  As to (D) MPEP §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  states  “[c]itation  of  and  reliance  upon  an  abstract  without  citation  of  and  reliance  upon  the  underlying  scientific  document  is  generally  inappropriate  where  both  the  abstract and the underlying document are prior art.

10894	(D)  Do  not  reject  claim  1  based  on  the  abstract;  instead,  obtain  a  translation  of  the  German-language  document  and  determine  whether  its  full  disclosure  supports  a  rejection under 35 USC 102(b) or 103. 	981	t	23.  ANSWER:   (A)  or  (D)  is  accepted  as  correct.    As  to  (A),  MPEP  §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection  in  a  non-final  Office  action  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  abstract  only  without  relying  on  the  full  text  document.”    In  the  facts,  the  “published  abstract  provides  an  adequate  basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.”  As to (D) MPEP §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  states  “[c]itation  of  and  reliance  upon  an  abstract  without  citation  of  and  reliance  upon  the  underlying  scientific  document  is  generally  inappropriate  where  both  the  abstract and the underlying document are prior art.

10895	(E)  Do  not  reject  the  claims  based  on  the  abstract  because  an  abstract  can  never  provide sufficient disclosure to be enabling. 	981	f	23.  ANSWER:   (A)  or  (D)  is  accepted  as  correct.    As  to  (A),  MPEP  §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,” states “[i]n limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection  in  a  non-final  Office  action  based  in  whole  or  in  part  on  the  abstract  only  without  relying  on  the  full  text  document.”    In  the  facts,  the  “published  abstract  provides  an  adequate  basis for concluding that claim 1 is prima facie obvious under 35 USC 103.”  As to (D) MPEP §  706.02,  under  the  heading  “Reliance  Upon  Abstracts  And  Foreign  Language  Documents  In  Support  Of  A  Rejection,”  states  “[c]itation  of  and  reliance  upon  an  abstract  without  citation  of  and  reliance  upon  the  underlying  scientific  document  is  generally  inappropriate  where  both  the  abstract and the underlying document are prior art.

Even  pictures  may  constitute  an  enabling  disclosure  in  some  cases  (MPEP § 2121.04).
10966	(A) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the assignee. 	996	f	38. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In  the  case  of  a  division  or  continuation  application,  a  prior  assignment  recorded  against  the  original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to  both  applications.”  MPEP  §  307  states,  “Irrespective  of  whether  the  assignee  participates  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  the  patent  issues  to  the  assignee  if  so  indicated  on  the  Issue  Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B. Unless an assignee's name and address are identified in item 3 of the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to the applicant. Assignment data  printed  on  the  patent  will  be  based  solely  on  the  information  so  supplied.”  A  new  assignment document need not be recorded for a divisional or continuation application where the assignment recorded in the parent application remains the same.  Accordingly, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address  are  identified  in  item  3  of  PTOL-85B,  the  patent  will  issued  to  the  applicant  and  the  assignee  information,  even  if  recorded,  will  not  appear  on  the  patent.    (C)  is  incorrect  for  the  same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent  application  publication  when  applicant  includes  assignment  information  for  purposes  of  publication  of  the  application  on  the  transmittal  letter.    Assignment  data  printed  on  the  patent  will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, (E) is correct and (C) is incorrect.
10896	(A) Tuesday, November 30, 1999 	982	f	24. ANSWER:   The filing date of the nonprovisional application, (B), is the correct answer. See  MPEP  §  201.04(b),  which  states  “[t]he  [Uruguay  Agreement  Round  Act]  provides  a  mechanism   to   enable   domestic   applicants   to   quickly   and   inexpensively   file   provisional   applications.    Under  the  provisions  of  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  applicants  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit of priority in a given application in the United States.  The domestic priority period will not  count  in  the  measurement  of  the  20-year  patent  term.    See  35  U.S.C.  154(a)(3).    Thus,  domestic  applicants  are  placed  on  the  same  footing  with  foreign  applicants  with  respect  to  the  patent  term.”    A  provisional  application  is  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  and  according  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(3),  such  a  filing  date  is  not  taken  into  account  in  determining  patent  term.    Therefore,  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  fact  pattern  states  that  benefit  was  properly  claimed  in  the  international application to both the provisional application and the national application and that the national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. § 371 claimed benefit to the filing date of the nonprovisional  application  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120.    According  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2),  where  an application contains a reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  the  patent  term  ends  20  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  such  application  was  filed;  in  this  fact  pattern  that  date  would  be  (B),  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional application.  The filing date of the international application, (C), is not correct in view  of  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  since  the  international  application  claimed  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C. § 120 to the filing date of the nonprovisional application.  The date of commencement of the national stage in the United States, (D), is not correct, since the date of commencement of the national  stage  in  the  U.S.  is  not  relevant  in  the  determination  of  the  patent  term  of  a  patent  issuing  form  the  national  stage  of  the  international  application.    Furthermore,  as  noted  in  (B)  above,  since  the  international  application  claims  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C.  §120  to  the  nonprovisional  application,  the  patent  term  of  the  patent  issuing  from  the  national  stage  is  measured  from  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional  application.  Finally,  the  issue  date,  (E),  is  not correct, because in 1994, 35 U.S.C. § 154 was amended to provide that for applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of a patent begins on the date the patent issues and ends on the date  that  is  twenty  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  application  for  the  patent  was  filed  in  the  United States or, of the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  twenty  years  from  the  filing  date  of  the  earliest of such application(s). 
10897	(B) Tuesday, November 28, 2000 	982	t	24. ANSWER:   The filing date of the nonprovisional application, (B), is the correct answer. See  MPEP  §  201.04(b),  which  states  “[t]he  [Uruguay  Agreement  Round  Act]  provides  a  mechanism   to   enable   domestic   applicants   to   quickly   and   inexpensively   file   provisional   applications.    Under  the  provisions  of  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  applicants  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit of priority in a given application in the United States.  The domestic priority period will not  count  in  the  measurement  of  the  20-year  patent  term.    See  35  U.S.C.  154(a)(3).    Thus,  domestic  applicants  are  placed  on  the  same  footing  with  foreign  applicants  with  respect  to  the  patent  term.”    A  provisional  application  is  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  and  according  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(3),  such  a  filing  date  is  not  taken  into  account  in  determining  patent  term.    Therefore,  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  fact  pattern  states  that  benefit  was  properly  claimed  in  the  international application to both the provisional application and the national application and that the national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. § 371 claimed benefit to the filing date of the nonprovisional  application  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120.    According  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2),  where  an application contains a reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  the  patent  term  ends  20  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  such  application  was  filed;  in  this  fact  pattern  that  date  would  be  (B),  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional application.  The filing date of the international application, (C), is not correct in view  of  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  since  the  international  application  claimed  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C. § 120 to the filing date of the nonprovisional application.  The date of commencement of the national stage in the United States, (D), is not correct, since the date of commencement of the national  stage  in  the  U.S.  is  not  relevant  in  the  determination  of  the  patent  term  of  a  patent  issuing  form  the  national  stage  of  the  international  application.    Furthermore,  as  noted  in  (B)  above,  since  the  international  application  claims  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C.  §120  to  the  nonprovisional  application,  the  patent  term  of  the  patent  issuing  from  the  national  stage  is  measured  from  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional  application.  Finally,  the  issue  date,  (E),  is  not correct, because in 1994, 35 U.S.C. § 154 was amended to provide that for applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of a patent begins on the date the patent issues and ends on the date  that  is  twenty  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  application  for  the  patent  was  filed  in  the  United States or, of the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  twenty  years  from  the  filing  date  of  the  earliest of such application(s). 
10898	(C) Wednesday, November 29, 2000	982	f	24. ANSWER:   The filing date of the nonprovisional application, (B), is the correct answer. See  MPEP  §  201.04(b),  which  states  “[t]he  [Uruguay  Agreement  Round  Act]  provides  a  mechanism   to   enable   domestic   applicants   to   quickly   and   inexpensively   file   provisional   applications.    Under  the  provisions  of  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  applicants  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit of priority in a given application in the United States.  The domestic priority period will not  count  in  the  measurement  of  the  20-year  patent  term.    See  35  U.S.C.  154(a)(3).    Thus,  domestic  applicants  are  placed  on  the  same  footing  with  foreign  applicants  with  respect  to  the  patent  term.”    A  provisional  application  is  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  and  according  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(3),  such  a  filing  date  is  not  taken  into  account  in  determining  patent  term.    Therefore,  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  fact  pattern  states  that  benefit  was  properly  claimed  in  the  international application to both the provisional application and the national application and that the national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. § 371 claimed benefit to the filing date of the nonprovisional  application  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120.    According  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2),  where  an application contains a reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  the  patent  term  ends  20  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  such  application  was  filed;  in  this  fact  pattern  that  date  would  be  (B),  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional application.  The filing date of the international application, (C), is not correct in view  of  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  since  the  international  application  claimed  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C. § 120 to the filing date of the nonprovisional application.  The date of commencement of the national stage in the United States, (D), is not correct, since the date of commencement of the national  stage  in  the  U.S.  is  not  relevant  in  the  determination  of  the  patent  term  of  a  patent  issuing  form  the  national  stage  of  the  international  application.    Furthermore,  as  noted  in  (B)  above,  since  the  international  application  claims  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C.  §120  to  the  nonprovisional  application,  the  patent  term  of  the  patent  issuing  from  the  national  stage  is  measured  from  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional  application.  Finally,  the  issue  date,  (E),  is  not correct, because in 1994, 35 U.S.C. § 154 was amended to provide that for applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of a patent begins on the date the patent issues and ends on the date  that  is  twenty  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  application  for  the  patent  was  filed  in  the  United States or, of the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  twenty  years  from  the  filing  date  of  the  earliest of such application(s). 
10899	(D) Friday, July 28, 2001	982	f	24. ANSWER:   The filing date of the nonprovisional application, (B), is the correct answer. See  MPEP  §  201.04(b),  which  states  “[t]he  [Uruguay  Agreement  Round  Act]  provides  a  mechanism   to   enable   domestic   applicants   to   quickly   and   inexpensively   file   provisional   applications.    Under  the  provisions  of  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  applicants  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit of priority in a given application in the United States.  The domestic priority period will not  count  in  the  measurement  of  the  20-year  patent  term.    See  35  U.S.C.  154(a)(3).    Thus,  domestic  applicants  are  placed  on  the  same  footing  with  foreign  applicants  with  respect  to  the  patent  term.”    A  provisional  application  is  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  and  according  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(3),  such  a  filing  date  is  not  taken  into  account  in  determining  patent  term.    Therefore,  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  fact  pattern  states  that  benefit  was  properly  claimed  in  the  international application to both the provisional application and the national application and that the national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. § 371 claimed benefit to the filing date of the nonprovisional  application  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120.    According  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2),  where  an application contains a reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  the  patent  term  ends  20  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  such  application  was  filed;  in  this  fact  pattern  that  date  would  be  (B),  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional application.  The filing date of the international application, (C), is not correct in view  of  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  since  the  international  application  claimed  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C. § 120 to the filing date of the nonprovisional application.  The date of commencement of the national stage in the United States, (D), is not correct, since the date of commencement of the national  stage  in  the  U.S.  is  not  relevant  in  the  determination  of  the  patent  term  of  a  patent  issuing  form  the  national  stage  of  the  international  application.    Furthermore,  as  noted  in  (B)  above,  since  the  international  application  claims  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C.  §120  to  the  nonprovisional  application,  the  patent  term  of  the  patent  issuing  from  the  national  stage  is  measured  from  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional  application.  Finally,  the  issue  date,  (E),  is  not correct, because in 1994, 35 U.S.C. § 154 was amended to provide that for applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of a patent begins on the date the patent issues and ends on the date  that  is  twenty  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  application  for  the  patent  was  filed  in  the  United States or, of the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  twenty  years  from  the  filing  date  of  the  earliest of such application(s). 
10900	(E) Tuesday, February 4, 2003 	982	f	24. ANSWER:   The filing date of the nonprovisional application, (B), is the correct answer. See  MPEP  §  201.04(b),  which  states  “[t]he  [Uruguay  Agreement  Round  Act]  provides  a  mechanism   to   enable   domestic   applicants   to   quickly   and   inexpensively   file   provisional   applications.    Under  the  provisions  of  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  applicants  are  entitled  to  claim  the  benefit of priority in a given application in the United States.  The domestic priority period will not  count  in  the  measurement  of  the  20-year  patent  term.    See  35  U.S.C.  154(a)(3).    Thus,  domestic  applicants  are  placed  on  the  same  footing  with  foreign  applicants  with  respect  to  the  patent  term.”    A  provisional  application  is  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §  119(e)  and  according  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(3),  such  a  filing  date  is  not  taken  into  account  in  determining  patent  term.    Therefore,  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  fact  pattern  states  that  benefit  was  properly  claimed  in  the  international application to both the provisional application and the national application and that the national stage application filed under 35 U.S.C. § 371 claimed benefit to the filing date of the nonprovisional  application  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120.    According  to  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2),  where  an application contains a reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  the  patent  term  ends  20  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  such  application  was  filed;  in  this  fact  pattern  that  date  would  be  (B),  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional application.  The filing date of the international application, (C), is not correct in view  of  35  U.S.C.  §  154(a)(2)  since  the  international  application  claimed  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C. § 120 to the filing date of the nonprovisional application.  The date of commencement of the national stage in the United States, (D), is not correct, since the date of commencement of the national  stage  in  the  U.S.  is  not  relevant  in  the  determination  of  the  patent  term  of  a  patent  issuing  form  the  national  stage  of  the  international  application.    Furthermore,  as  noted  in  (B)  above,  since  the  international  application  claims  the  benefit  under  35  U.S.C.  §120  to  the  nonprovisional  application,  the  patent  term  of  the  patent  issuing  from  the  national  stage  is  measured  from  the  filing  date  of  the  nonprovisional  application.  Finally,  the  issue  date,  (E),  is  not correct, because in 1994, 35 U.S.C. § 154 was amended to provide that for applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, the term of a patent begins on the date the patent issues and ends on the date  that  is  twenty  years  from  the  date  on  which  the  application  for  the  patent  was  filed  in  the  United States or, of the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications  under  35  U.S.C.  §  120,  121,  or  365(c),  twenty  years  from  the  filing  date  of  the  earliest of such application(s). 
11057	(B) A rejection properly made under 35 USC 102(d) based on a foreign patent granted in a non-WTO country.	1014	f	6.     ANSWER:  (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  715.    (A)  is  incorrect  because  an  affidavit  under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where the reference is a prior U.S. patent to the same entity,  claiming  the  same  invention.  MPEP  §  715.    (B)  and  (D)  are  each  incorrect  because  an  affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where the reference is a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(d) as in (B) or a statutory bar under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as in (D).  MPEP § 715.  (C) is incorrect because an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 1.131 is not appropriate where applicant has clearly admitted on the record that subject matter relied on in the reference is prior art. MPEP § 715. 
10901	(A) The added claims are rejected for lack of written description under 35 USC 112, first paragraph.	983	f	25.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Both  (A)  and  (C)  are  correct.    MPEP  §  2163.01,  under  the  heading  “Support  For  The  Claimed  Subject  Matter  In  The  Disclosure,”  states  that  “[I]f  the  examiner  concludes  that  the  claimed  subject  matter  is  not  supported  [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing  date  of  a  previously  filed  application.”    (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2163.01  states  that  unsupported  claims  “should  not  be  rejected  or  objected  to  on  the  ground  of  new  matter.    As  framed  by  the  court  in  In  re  Rasmussen,  650  F.2d  1212,  211  USPQ  323  (CCPA  1981),  the  concept  of  new  matter  is  properly  employed  as  a  basis  for  objection  to  amendments  to  the  abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because (B) is incorrect. 
10902	(B) The added claims are rejected as new matter under 35 USC 132. 	983	f	25.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Both  (A)  and  (C)  are  correct.    MPEP  §  2163.01,  under  the  heading  “Support  For  The  Claimed  Subject  Matter  In  The  Disclosure,”  states  that  “[I]f  the  examiner  concludes  that  the  claimed  subject  matter  is  not  supported  [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing  date  of  a  previously  filed  application.”    (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2163.01  states  that  unsupported  claims  “should  not  be  rejected  or  objected  to  on  the  ground  of  new  matter.    As  framed  by  the  court  in  In  re  Rasmussen,  650  F.2d  1212,  211  USPQ  323  (CCPA  1981),  the  concept  of  new  matter  is  properly  employed  as  a  basis  for  objection  to  amendments  to  the  abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because (B) is incorrect. 
10903	(C) The added claims are denied benefit of the filing date of the 2000 application. 	983	f	25.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Both  (A)  and  (C)  are  correct.    MPEP  §  2163.01,  under  the  heading  “Support  For  The  Claimed  Subject  Matter  In  The  Disclosure,”  states  that  “[I]f  the  examiner  concludes  that  the  claimed  subject  matter  is  not  supported  [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing  date  of  a  previously  filed  application.”    (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2163.01  states  that  unsupported  claims  “should  not  be  rejected  or  objected  to  on  the  ground  of  new  matter.    As  framed  by  the  court  in  In  re  Rasmussen,  650  F.2d  1212,  211  USPQ  323  (CCPA  1981),  the  concept  of  new  matter  is  properly  employed  as  a  basis  for  objection  to  amendments  to  the  abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because (B) is incorrect. 
10904	(D)      (A)      and      (B).      	983	f	25.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Both  (A)  and  (C)  are  correct.    MPEP  §  2163.01,  under  the  heading  “Support  For  The  Claimed  Subject  Matter  In  The  Disclosure,”  states  that  “[I]f  the  examiner  concludes  that  the  claimed  subject  matter  is  not  supported  [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing  date  of  a  previously  filed  application.”    (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2163.01  states  that  unsupported  claims  “should  not  be  rejected  or  objected  to  on  the  ground  of  new  matter.    As  framed  by  the  court  in  In  re  Rasmussen,  650  F.2d  1212,  211  USPQ  323  (CCPA  1981),  the  concept  of  new  matter  is  properly  employed  as  a  basis  for  objection  to  amendments  to  the  abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because (B) is incorrect. 
10905	(E)       (A)       and       (C). 	983	t	25.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Both  (A)  and  (C)  are  correct.    MPEP  §  2163.01,  under  the  heading  “Support  For  The  Claimed  Subject  Matter  In  The  Disclosure,”  states  that  “[I]f  the  examiner  concludes  that  the  claimed  subject  matter  is  not  supported  [described] in an application as filed, this would result in a rejection of the claim on the ground of a lack of written description under 35 U.S.C. 112, first paragraph, or denial of the benefit of filing  date  of  a  previously  filed  application.”    (B)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  2163.01  states  that  unsupported  claims  “should  not  be  rejected  or  objected  to  on  the  ground  of  new  matter.    As  framed  by  the  court  in  In  re  Rasmussen,  650  F.2d  1212,  211  USPQ  323  (CCPA  1981),  the  concept  of  new  matter  is  properly  employed  as  a  basis  for  objection  to  amendments  to  the  abstract, specification or drawings attempting to add new disclosure to that originally presented.”  (D) is incorrect because (B) is incorrect. 
10906	(A) In a timely reply to a non-final Office action, where the examiner’s sole rejection of   appellant’s   claims   is   based   on   an   alleged   violation   of   the   enablement   requirement of 35 USC 112.	984	f	26. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715, under the heading “Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits or Declarations Can Be Used,” provides that an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.131 may be used to antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a)  but  not  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    Also,  MPEP  §  716  provides  that  objective  evidence  traversing  a  rejection  may  be  presented  in  a  timely  submitted  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.132.    As  for  (A),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  not  serve  any  useful  purpose  in  those  situations.    See  MPEP  §  715.    Regarding  (C),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  be  inappropriate.    See  MPEP  §  715,  under  the  heading  “Situations  Where  37  CXFR  1.131  Affidavits  or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate.”    As  for  (D)  and  (E),  a  reply  including  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  and  37  CFR  §  1.132  normally  would  be  considered  untimely  under  the  circumstances set forth in those answers.  See 37 CFR §§ 1.116, 1.192(a) and 1.195.  Also, see MPEP §§ 715.09 and 716.01.   Consequently, (B) is the most correct answer.  
11138	(C) If during the course of examination of a patent application, an examiner notes the use of language that could be deemed offensive to any race, religion, sex, ethnicgroup, or nationality, he or she should object to the use of the language as failing to comply with the Rules of Practice. 	1030	f	22.   ANSWER:  (E)  is  incorrect  as  a  preliminary  amendment  may  be  filed  with  the  original  disclosure  and  will  be  treated  as  part  of  the  original  disclosure  in  accordance  with  MPEP  § 608.04(b)  (A) through (D) are all correct.  See MPEP § 608 at p. 600-53.
10907	(B) In a timely reply to non-final Office action, where the examiner’s sole rejection of appellant’s  claims  is  a  rejection  under  35  USC  103(a)  employing  a  non-patent  document  that  was  published  less  than  one  year  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  appellant’s patent application. 	984	t	26. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715, under the heading “Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits or Declarations Can Be Used,” provides that an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.131 may be used to antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a)  but  not  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    Also,  MPEP  §  716  provides  that  objective  evidence  traversing  a  rejection  may  be  presented  in  a  timely  submitted  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.132.    As  for  (A),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  not  serve  any  useful  purpose  in  those  situations.    See  MPEP  §  715.    Regarding  (C),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  be  inappropriate.    See  MPEP  §  715,  under  the  heading  “Situations  Where  37  CXFR  1.131  Affidavits  or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate.”    As  for  (D)  and  (E),  a  reply  including  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  and  37  CFR  §  1.132  normally  would  be  considered  untimely  under  the  circumstances set forth in those answers.  See 37 CFR §§ 1.116, 1.192(a) and 1.195.  Also, see MPEP §§ 715.09 and 716.01.   Consequently, (B) is the most correct answer.  
10908	(C) In a timely reply to a non-final Office action, where the examiner’s sole rejection of  appellant’s  claims  is  a  rejection  under  35  USC  103(a)  employing  a  non-commonly  owned  U.S.  patent  as  prior  art  under  35  USC  102  (e)  that  claims  the  same invention as applicant. 	984	f	26. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.

Regarding  (C),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  be  inappropriate.    See  MPEP  §  715,  under  the  heading  “Situations  Where  37  CXFR  1.131  Affidavits  or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate.”    As  for  (D)  and  (E),  a  reply  including  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  and  37  CFR  §  1.132  normally  would  be  considered  untimely  under  the  circumstances set forth in those answers.  See 37 CFR §§ 1.116, 1.192(a) and 1.195.  Also, see MPEP §§ 715.09 and 716.01.   Consequently, (B) is the most correct answer.  
10909	(D)  In  a  timely  reply  to  an  examiner’s  answer  presenting  the  affidavits  for  the  first  time, where in the examiner’s first Office action and final rejection, the examiner maintains  the  same  rejection  under  35  USC  103(a)  of  all  of  appellant’s  claims  based  in  part  on  a  non-patent  document  that  was  published  less  than  one  year  prior to the filing date of appellant’s patent application. 	984	f	26. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 715, under the heading “Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits or Declarations Can Be Used,” provides that an affidavit under 37 CFR § 1.131 may be used to antedate a reference that qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(a)  but  not  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).

As  for  (A),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  not  serve  any  useful  purpose  in  those  situations.    See  MPEP  §  715.    Regarding  (C),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  be  inappropriate.    See  MPEP  §  715,  under  the  heading  “Situations  Where  37  CXFR  1.131  Affidavits  or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate.”    As  for  (D)  and  (E),  a  reply  including  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  and  37  CFR  §  1.132  normally  would  be  considered  untimely  under  the  circumstances set forth in those answers.  See 37 CFR §§ 1.116, 1.192(a) and 1.195.  Also, see MPEP §§ 715.09 and 716.01.   Consequently, (B) is the most correct answer.  
10910	(E) In a timely reply to a final Office action presenting the affidavits for the first time, where  in  the  examiner’s  first  Office  action,  the  examiner’s  sole  rejection  of  appellant’s  claims  is  a  rejection  under  35  USC  103(a)  employing  a  non-patent  document  that  was  published  less  than  one  year  prior  to  the  filing  date  of  appellant’s patent application.	984	f	26.

Also,  MPEP  §  716  provides  that  objective  evidence  traversing  a  rejection  may  be  presented  in  a  timely  submitted  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.132.    As  for  (A),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  not  serve  any  useful  purpose  in  those  situations.    See  MPEP  §  715.    Regarding  (C),  an  affidavit  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  would  be  inappropriate.    See  MPEP  §  715,  under  the  heading  “Situations  Where  37  CXFR  1.131  Affidavits  or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate.”    As  for  (D)  and  (E),  a  reply  including  affidavits  under  37  CFR  §  1.131  and  37  CFR  §  1.132  normally  would  be  considered  untimely  under  the  circumstances set forth in those answers.  See 37 CFR §§ 1.116, 1.192(a) and 1.195.  Also, see MPEP §§ 715.09 and 716.01.   Consequently, (B) is the most correct answer.  
10927	(B) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and look for references which have a publication date prior to May 15, 2001.	988	f	30.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  (8th  Ed.)  §  715.07,  under  the  heading  “Facts  and  Documentary  Evidence”  states  that  “The  essential  thing  to  be  shown  under  37  CFR  1.131  is  priority  of  invention  and  this  may  be  done  by  any  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  fact.    FACTS, not conclusions, must be alleged.  Evidence in the form of exhibits may accompany the affidavit  or  declaration.  ...  The  affidavit  or  declaration  must  state  FACTS  and  produce  such  documentary  evidence  and  exhibits  in  support  thereof  as  are  available  to  show  conception  and  completion  of  invention  in  this  country  or  in  a  NAFTA  or  WTO  member  country  (MPEP  § 715.07(c)) at least the conception being at a date prior to the effective date of the reference. ... In  general,  proof  of  actual  reduction  to  practice  requires  a  showing  that  the  apparatus  actually  existed   and   worked   for   its   intended   purpose.”      Here,   the   co-inventors   admit,   and   the   documentary exhibits relied upon demonstrate that they failed to reduce the claimed invention to practice  prior  to  the  publication  date  of  the  Bell  and  Watson  reference.    It  is  also  apparent  that  due to the lack of an antenna in the cell phone described in Smith’s and Jones’s declarations and journal article, that the cell phone which was reduced to practice prior to the publication date of the Bell and Watson article would not have worked for its intended purpose.   Accordingly, the examiner should maintain the rejection and make it final.  (B) and (C) are incorrect choices since the evidence of record shows that Smith and Jones are unable to overcome the prior art.  (D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10911	(A) A sale conditioned on buyer satisfaction.	985	f	27.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    As  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A  Sale  of  Rights  Is  Not  a  Sale  of  the  Invention  and  Will  Not  in  Itself  Bar  a  Patent,”  “[a]n  assignment  or  sale  of  the  rights,  such  as  patent  rights,  in  the  invention  is  not  a  sale  of  ‘the  invention’  within  the  meaning  of  section  102(b). The sale must involve the delivery of the physical invention itself. Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1986).”  (A) is incorrect because  it  is  within  the  scope  of    “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A.  Conditional  Sale  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[a]n  invention  may  be  deemed  to  be  ‘on  sale’  even  though  the  sale  was  conditional.  The  fact  that  the  sale  is  conditioned  on  buyer  satisfaction  does  not,  without  more, prove that the sale was for an experimental purpose. Strong v. General Elec. Co., 434 F.2d 1042, 1046, 168 USPQ 8, 12 (5th Cir. 1970).”  (B) is incorrect because it is within the scope of  “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).  MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “Nonprofit  Sale  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[a]  ‘sale’  need  not  be for profit to bar a patent. If the sale was for the commercial exploitation of the invention, it is ‘on sale’ within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 102(b).

(C) is incorrect because it is within the scope of  “on sale” as it is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A  Single  Sale  or  Offer  To  Sell  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[e]ven  a  single  sale  or  offer  to  sell  the  invention  may  bar  patentability  under  35  U.S.C.  102(b).

10912	(B) A sale that did not result in a profit. 	985	f	27.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    As  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A  Sale  of  Rights  Is  Not  a  Sale  of  the  Invention  and  Will  Not  in  Itself  Bar  a  Patent,”  “[a]n  assignment  or  sale  of  the  rights,  such  as  patent  rights,  in  the  invention  is  not  a  sale  of  ‘the  invention’  within  the  meaning  of  section  102(b).

Cir. 1992).”  (D) is incorrect because it is within the  scope  of    “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b)  quotes  Group One,  Ltd.  v.  Hallmark  Cards,  Inc.,  254  F.2d  1041,  1047,  59  USPQ2d  1121,  1126  (Fed.  Cir.  2001) as stating “As a general proposition, we look to the Uniform Commercial Code (‘UCC’) to define  whether    ...  a  communication  or  series  of  communications  rises  to  the  level  of  a  commercial offer for sale.”
10935	(E) A drawing when required by 37 CFR 1.81(a). 	989	f	31.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01As provided in 37 CFR § 1.53(f) and MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is  granted  on  the  date  on  which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the  Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date.
10936	(A) A request to correct inventorship in a pending application. 	990	f	32.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  410  states  that  the  certification  requirement set forth in 37 CFR § 10.18(b) “has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in 37 CFR ...1.48 [correction of inventorship in a patent application], ...1.55 [claim for foreign priority], ...1.102 [petition to make an application special], [and] ... 1.125 [substitute specification].”
10915	(E) An offer to sale the patent rights in the claimed subject matter. 	985	t	27.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    As  set  forth  in  MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A  Sale  of  Rights  Is  Not  a  Sale  of  the  Invention  and  Will  Not  in  Itself  Bar  a  Patent,”  “[a]n  assignment  or  sale  of  the  rights,  such  as  patent  rights,  in  the  invention  is  not  a  sale  of  ‘the  invention’  within  the  meaning  of  section  102(b). The sale must involve the delivery of the physical invention itself. Moleculon Research Corp. v. CBS, Inc., 793 F.2d 1261, 1265, 229 USPQ 805, 809 (Fed. Cir. 1986).”  (A) is incorrect because  it  is  within  the  scope  of    “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A.  Conditional  Sale  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[a]n  invention  may  be  deemed  to  be  ‘on  sale’  even  though  the  sale  was  conditional.  The  fact  that  the  sale  is  conditioned  on  buyer  satisfaction  does  not,  without  more, prove that the sale was for an experimental purpose. Strong v. General Elec. Co., 434 F.2d 1042, 1046, 168 USPQ 8, 12 (5th Cir. 1970).”  (B) is incorrect because it is within the scope of  “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).  MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “Nonprofit  Sale  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[a]  ‘sale’  need  not  be for profit to bar a patent. If the sale was for the commercial exploitation of the invention, it is ‘on sale’ within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. 102(b). In re Dybel, 524 F.2d 1393, 1401, 187 USPQ 593, 599 (CCPA 1975) (‘Although selling the devices for a profit would have demonstrated the purpose of commercial exploitation, the fact that appellant realized no profit from the sales does not demonstrate the contrary.’).  (C) is incorrect because it is within the scope of  “on sale” as it is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b),  under  the  heading  “I.  The  Meaning  Of  ‘Sale’,”  subheading  “A  Single  Sale  or  Offer  To  Sell  May  Bar  a  Patent,”  states  “[e]ven  a  single  sale  or  offer  to  sell  the  invention  may  bar  patentability  under  35  U.S.C.  102(b).  Consolidated Fruit-Jar Co. v. Wright, 94 U.S. 92, 94 (1876); Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 970 F.2d 834, 836-37, 23 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 1992).”  (D) is incorrect because it is within the  scope  of    “on  sale”  as  it  is  used  in  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b).    MPEP  §  2133.03(b)  quotes  Group One,  Ltd.  v.  Hallmark  Cards,  Inc.,  254  F.2d  1041,  1047,  59  USPQ2d  1121,  1126  (Fed.  Cir.  2001) as stating “As a general proposition, we look to the Uniform Commercial Code (‘UCC’) to define  whether    ...  a  communication  or  series  of  communications  rises  to  the  level  of  a  commercial offer for sale.”
10916	(A) On April 1, 2004, a Notice of Appeal is filed together with appropriate fees, and a brief  pointing  out  that  a  patent  should  issue  since  the  subject  matter  of  the  electronics control unit was adequately described in the original specification. 	986	f	28.   ANSWER:   (B).   37   CFR   §   1.83(a);   MPEP   §§   608.01(l)   and   706.03(o).      MPEP   §   608.01(l)   states   “[w]here   subject   matter   not   shown   in   a   drawing...is   claimed   in   the   specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes a clear disclosure of this subject matter,  then  the  claim  should  be  treated  on  its  merits,  and  requirement  made  to  amend  the  drawing  and  description  to  show  this  subject  matter...It  is  the  drawing...that  [is]  defective,  not the claim.  It is, of course, to be understood that this disclosure in the claim must be sufficiently specific and detailed to support the necessary amendment of the drawing...”  MPEP § 608.02(d) and 706.03(o).  MPEP § 706.03(o), state “[i]f subject matter capable of illustration is originally claimed and it is not shown in the drawing, the claim is not rejected but applicant is required to add  it  to  the  drawing.    See  MPEP  §  608.01(l).”    (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    See  the  foregoing quotation from MPEP § 706.03(o).  (A) and (C) also are incorrect because objections to  drawings  are  petitionable,  not  appealable.    MPEP  §§  608.02,  under  the  heading  “Receipt  of  Drawing After Filing Date,” and 1002.  (D) is incorrect because the petition, filed more than six months  after  the  final  rejection,  is  not  timely.    A  timely  petition  would  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  mailing  date  of  the  action  or  notice  from  which  relief  is  requested.    See  35  U.S.C.  §  133;  37  CFR  §§  1.181(f),  1.134  and  1.135(a);  and  MPEP  §  710.01.    (E)  is  incorrect  because (B) is correct. 
10917	(B)  On  April  1,  2004,  a  drawing  is  filed  in  the  USPTO  illustrating  only  the  comparator  and  alarm  of  the  electronics  control  unit  that  was  described  in  the  original specification.	986	t	28.   ANSWER:   (B).   37   CFR   §   1.83(a);   MPEP   §§   608.01(l)   and   706.03(o).      MPEP   §   608.01(l)   states   “[w]here   subject   matter   not   shown   in   a   drawing...is   claimed   in   the   specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes a clear disclosure of this subject matter,  then  the  claim  should  be  treated  on  its  merits,  and  requirement  made  to  amend  the  drawing  and  description  to  show  this  subject  matter...It  is  the  drawing...that  [is]  defective,  not the claim.  It is, of course, to be understood that this disclosure in the claim must be sufficiently specific and detailed to support the necessary amendment of the drawing...”  MPEP § 608.02(d) and 706.03(o).  MPEP § 706.03(o), state “[i]f subject matter capable of illustration is originally claimed and it is not shown in the drawing, the claim is not rejected but applicant is required to add  it  to  the  drawing.    See  MPEP  §  608.01(l).”    (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    See  the  foregoing quotation from MPEP § 706.03(o).  (A) and (C) also are incorrect because objections to  drawings  are  petitionable,  not  appealable.    MPEP  §§  608.02,  under  the  heading  “Receipt  of  Drawing After Filing Date,” and 1002.  (D) is incorrect because the petition, filed more than six months  after  the  final  rejection,  is  not  timely.    A  timely  petition  would  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  mailing  date  of  the  action  or  notice  from  which  relief  is  requested.    See  35  U.S.C.  §  133;  37  CFR  §§  1.181(f),  1.134  and  1.135(a);  and  MPEP  §  710.01.    (E)  is  incorrect  because (B) is correct. 
10918	(C) On April 1, 2004, a Notice of Appeal of appeal is filed together with appropriate fees,  and  a  brief  pointing  out  that  the  addition  of  a  drawing  showing  the  electronics  control  unit  would  not  constitute  addition  of  new  matter  since  the  electronics control unit was adequately described in the original specification. 	986	f	28.   ANSWER:   (B).   37   CFR   §   1.83(a);   MPEP   §§   608.01(l)   and   706.03(o).      MPEP   §   608.01(l)   states   “[w]here   subject   matter   not   shown   in   a   drawing...is   claimed   in   the   specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes a clear disclosure of this subject matter,  then  the  claim  should  be  treated  on  its  merits,  and  requirement  made  to  amend  the  drawing  and  description  to  show  this  subject  matter...It  is  the  drawing...that  [is]  defective,  not the claim.  It is, of course, to be understood that this disclosure in the claim must be sufficiently specific and detailed to support the necessary amendment of the drawing...”  MPEP § 608.02(d) and 706.03(o).  MPEP § 706.03(o), state “[i]f subject matter capable of illustration is originally claimed and it is not shown in the drawing, the claim is not rejected but applicant is required to add  it  to  the  drawing.    See  MPEP  §  608.01(l).”    (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    See  the  foregoing quotation from MPEP § 706.03(o).  (A) and (C) also are incorrect because objections to  drawings  are  petitionable,  not  appealable.    MPEP  §§  608.02,  under  the  heading  “Receipt  of  Drawing After Filing Date,” and 1002.  (D) is incorrect because the petition, filed more than six months  after  the  final  rejection,  is  not  timely.    A  timely  petition  would  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  mailing  date  of  the  action  or  notice  from  which  relief  is  requested.    See  35  U.S.C.  §  133;  37  CFR  §§  1.181(f),  1.134  and  1.135(a);  and  MPEP  §  710.01.    (E)  is  incorrect  because (B) is correct. 
10937	(B) A petition to make an application special.	990	f	32.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  410  states  that  the  certification  requirement set forth in 37 CFR § 10.18(b) “has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in 37 CFR ...1.48 [correction of inventorship in a patent application], ...1.55 [claim for foreign priority], ...1.102 [petition to make an application special], [and] ... 1.125 [substitute specification].”
11568	(E)II and III	1116	f	6. ANSWER: (D) is the correct answer. MPEP § 706.07(b). In both I and III the finality is improper. MPEP § 706.07(b). Therefore (A) and (C) are incorrect. In II the finality is proper. MPEP § 706.07(b). Therefore (B) and (E) are incorrect.
10919	(D) On September 1, 2004, a petition is filed urging that no further drawing should be required because the subject matter of the electronics control unit, for purposes of the application, was adequately disclosed in the block diagram drawing. 	986	f	28.   ANSWER:   (B).   37   CFR   §   1.83(a);   MPEP   §§   608.01(l)   and   706.03(o).      MPEP   §   608.01(l)   states   “[w]here   subject   matter   not   shown   in   a   drawing...is   claimed   in   the   specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes a clear disclosure of this subject matter,  then  the  claim  should  be  treated  on  its  merits,  and  requirement  made  to  amend  the  drawing  and  description  to  show  this  subject  matter...It  is  the  drawing...that  [is]  defective,  not the claim.  It is, of course, to be understood that this disclosure in the claim must be sufficiently specific and detailed to support the necessary amendment of the drawing...”  MPEP § 608.02(d) and 706.03(o).

See  MPEP  §  608.01(l).”    (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    See  the  foregoing quotation from MPEP § 706.03(o).  (A) and (C) also are incorrect because objections to  drawings  are  petitionable,  not  appealable.    MPEP  §§  608.02,  under  the  heading  “Receipt  of  Drawing After Filing Date,” and 1002.  (D) is incorrect because the petition, filed more than six months  after  the  final  rejection,  is  not  timely.    A  timely  petition  would  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  mailing  date  of  the  action  or  notice  from  which  relief  is  requested.    See  35  U.S.C.  §  133;  37  CFR  §§  1.181(f),  1.134  and  1.135(a);  and  MPEP  §  710.01.    (E)  is  incorrect  because (B) is correct. 
10920	(E) None of the above. 	986	f	28.   ANSWER:   (B).   37   CFR   §   1.83(a);   MPEP   §§   608.01(l)   and   706.03(o).      MPEP   §   608.01(l)   states   “[w]here   subject   matter   not   shown   in   a   drawing...is   claimed   in   the   specification as filed, and such original claim itself constitutes a clear disclosure of this subject matter,  then  the  claim  should  be  treated  on  its  merits,  and  requirement  made  to  amend  the  drawing  and  description  to  show  this  subject  matter...It  is  the  drawing...that  [is]  defective,  not the claim.

See  MPEP  §  608.01(l).”    (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  incorrect.    See  the  foregoing quotation from MPEP § 706.03(o).  (A) and (C) also are incorrect because objections to  drawings  are  petitionable,  not  appealable.    MPEP  §§  608.02,  under  the  heading  “Receipt  of  Drawing After Filing Date,” and 1002.  (D) is incorrect because the petition, filed more than six months  after  the  final  rejection,  is  not  timely.    A  timely  petition  would  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  mailing  date  of  the  action  or  notice  from  which  relief  is  requested.    See  35  U.S.C.  §  133;  37  CFR  §§  1.181(f),  1.134  and  1.135(a);  and  MPEP  §  710.01.    (E)  is  incorrect  because (B) is correct. 
10921	(A) Friday, February 6, 2004 (assume not a Federal holiday). 	987	f	29.  ANSWER:   The  correct  answer  is  (C).    See  35  U.S.C.  §  172;  MPEP  §  1504.02.  35  U.S.C. § 172 provides that the time specified in 35 U.S.C. 102(d) shall be six months in the case of  designs.    Thus,  to  avoid  a  statutory  bar  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(d),  the  U.S.  design  patent  application must be made within six months of the foreign filing, i.e., by August 6, 2003.  MPEP §  1504.02  states  “[r]egistration  of  a  design  abroad  is  considered  to  be  equivalent  to  patenting  under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d) and 35 U.S.C. 102(d), whether or not the foreign grant is published. (See Ex parte Lancaster, 151 USPQ 713 (Bd. App. 1965); Ex parte Marinissen, 155 USPQ 528 (Bd. App. 1966); Appeal No. 239-48, Decided April 30, 1965, 151 USPQ 711, (Bd. App. 1965); Ex  parte  Appeal  decided  September  3,  1968,  866  O.G.  16  (Bd.  App.  1966).  The  basis  of  this  practice is that if the foreign applicant has received the protection offered in the foreign country, no matter what the protection is called (‘patent,’ ‘Design Registration,’ etc.), if the United States application  is  timely  filed,  a  claim  for  priority  will  vest.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  U.S.  application  is  not  timely  filed,  a  statutory  bar  arises  under  35  U.S.C.  102(d)  as  modified  by  35  U.S.C.  172.  In  order  for  the  filing  to  be  timely  for  priority  purposes  and  to  avoid  possible  statutory  bars,  the  U.S.  design  patent  application  must  be  made  within  6  months  of  the  foreign  filing.”  (A) and (B) are incorrect because they are after the six month period.  (D) is not correct because it is not the latest date for filing as required by the question.  (E) is not correct because answer (C) is correct. 
10922	(B) Thursday, February 5, 2004 (assume not a Federal holiday). 	987	f	29.  ANSWER:   The  correct  answer  is  (C).    See  35  U.S.C.  §  172;  MPEP  §  1504.02.  35  U.S.C. § 172 provides that the time specified in 35 U.S.C. 102(d) shall be six months in the case of  designs.

(D) is not correct because it is not the latest date for filing as required by the question.  (E) is not correct because answer (C) is correct. 
10938	(C) A claim for foreign priority. 	990	f	32.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  410  states  that  the  certification  requirement set forth in 37 CFR § 10.18(b) “has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in 37 CFR ...1.48 [correction of inventorship in a patent application], ...1.55 [claim for foreign priority], ...1.102 [petition to make an application special], [and] ... 1.125 [substitute specification].”
10923	(C) Wednesday, August 6, 2003.	987	t	29.  ANSWER:   The  correct  answer  is  (C).    See  35  U.S.C.  §  172;  MPEP  §  1504.02.  35  U.S.C. § 172 provides that the time specified in 35 U.S.C. 102(d) shall be six months in the case of  designs.

(See Ex parte Lancaster, 151 USPQ 713 (Bd. App. 1965); Ex parte Marinissen, 155 USPQ 528 (Bd. App. 1966); Appeal No. 239-48, Decided April 30, 1965, 151 USPQ 711, (Bd. App. 1965); Ex  parte  Appeal  decided  September  3,  1968,  866  O.G.  16  (Bd.  App.  1966).  The  basis  of  this  practice is that if the foreign applicant has received the protection offered in the foreign country, no matter what the protection is called (‘patent,’ ‘Design Registration,’ etc.), if the United States application  is  timely  filed,  a  claim  for  priority  will  vest.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  the  U.S.  application  is  not  timely  filed,  a  statutory  bar  arises  under  35  U.S.C.  102(d)  as  modified  by  35  U.S.C.  172.  In  order  for  the  filing  to  be  timely  for  priority  purposes  and  to  avoid  possible  statutory  bars,  the  U.S.  design  patent  application  must  be  made  within  6  months  of  the  foreign  filing.”  (A) and (B) are incorrect because they are after the six month period.  (D) is not correct because it is not the latest date for filing as required by the question.  (E) is not correct because answer (C) is correct. 
10924	(D) Wednesday, May 6, 2003.	987	f	29.  ANSWER:   The  correct  answer  is  (C).    See  35  U.S.C.  §  172;  MPEP  §  1504.02.  35  U.S.C. § 172 provides that the time specified in 35 U.S.C. 102(d) shall be six months in the case of  designs.    Thus,  to  avoid  a  statutory  bar  under  35  U.S.C.  §  102(d),  the  U.S.  design  patent  application must be made within six months of the foreign filing, i.e., by August 6, 2003.

(D) is not correct because it is not the latest date for filing as required by the question.  (E) is not correct because answer (C) is correct. 
10925	(E) None of the above are correct. 	987	f	29.  ANSWER:   The  correct  answer  is  (C).    See  35  U.S.C.  §  172;  MPEP  §  1504.02.  35  U.S.C. § 172 provides that the time specified in 35 U.S.C. 102(d) shall be six months in the case of  designs.

(D) is not correct because it is not the latest date for filing as required by the question.  (E) is not correct because answer (C) is correct. 
10926	(A)  The  examiner  should  maintain  the  rejection  of  the  claims  under  35  USC  102(a)  and make the rejection final.	988	t	30.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  (8th  Ed.)  §  715.07,  under  the  heading  “Facts  and  Documentary  Evidence”  states  that  “The  essential  thing  to  be  shown  under  37  CFR  1.131  is  priority  of  invention  and  this  may  be  done  by  any  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  fact.    FACTS, not conclusions, must be alleged.  Evidence in the form of exhibits may accompany the affidavit  or  declaration.  ...  The  affidavit  or  declaration  must  state  FACTS  and  produce  such  documentary  evidence  and  exhibits  in  support  thereof  as  are  available  to  show  conception  and  completion  of  invention  in  this  country  or  in  a  NAFTA  or  WTO  member  country  (MPEP  § 715.07(c)) at least the conception being at a date prior to the effective date of the reference. ... In  general,  proof  of  actual  reduction  to  practice  requires  a  showing  that  the  apparatus  actually  existed   and   worked   for   its   intended   purpose.”      Here,   the   co-inventors   admit,   and   the   documentary exhibits relied upon demonstrate that they failed to reduce the claimed invention to practice  prior  to  the  publication  date  of  the  Bell  and  Watson  reference.    It  is  also  apparent  that  due to the lack of an antenna in the cell phone described in Smith’s and Jones’s declarations and journal article, that the cell phone which was reduced to practice prior to the publication date of the Bell and Watson article would not have worked for its intended purpose.   Accordingly, the examiner should maintain the rejection and make it final.  (B) and (C) are incorrect choices since the evidence of record shows that Smith and Jones are unable to overcome the prior art.  (D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10939	(D) A substitute specification.	990	f	32.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  410  states  that  the  certification  requirement set forth in 37 CFR § 10.18(b) “has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in 37 CFR ...1.48 [correction of inventorship in a patent application], ...1.55 [claim for foreign priority], ...1.102 [petition to make an application special], [and] ... 1.125 [substitute specification].”
10940	(E) None of the above. 	990	t	32.  ANSWER:   (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  410  states  that  the  certification  requirement set forth in 37 CFR § 10.18(b) “has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in 37 CFR ...1.48 [correction of inventorship in a patent application], ...1.55 [claim for foreign priority], ...1.102 [petition to make an application special], [and] ... 1.125 [substitute specification].”
10928	(C) The examiner should withdraw the rejection and notify Smith and Jones that their application is in condition for allowance. 	988	f	30.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  (8th  Ed.)  §  715.07,  under  the  heading  “Facts  and  Documentary  Evidence”  states  that  “The  essential  thing  to  be  shown  under  37  CFR  1.131  is  priority  of  invention  and  this  may  be  done  by  any  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  fact.

The  affidavit  or  declaration  must  state  FACTS  and  produce  such  documentary  evidence  and  exhibits  in  support  thereof  as  are  available  to  show  conception  and  completion  of  invention  in  this  country  or  in  a  NAFTA  or  WTO  member  country  (MPEP  § 715.07(c)) at least the conception being at a date prior to the effective date of the reference. ... In  general,  proof  of  actual  reduction  to  practice  requires  a  showing  that  the  apparatus  actually  existed   and   worked   for   its   intended   purpose.”      Here,   the   co-inventors   admit,   and   the   documentary exhibits relied upon demonstrate that they failed to reduce the claimed invention to practice  prior  to  the  publication  date  of  the  Bell  and  Watson  reference.

(B) and (C) are incorrect choices since the evidence of record shows that Smith and Jones are unable to overcome the prior art.  (D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10929	(D) The examiner should maintain the rejection, but indicate that the claims would be allowable if Smith and Jones provided an original copy of the figure published in their journal article as factual support for their declarations. 	988	f	30.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  (8th  Ed.)  §  715.07,  under  the  heading  “Facts  and  Documentary  Evidence”  states  that  “The  essential  thing  to  be  shown  under  37  CFR  1.131  is  priority  of  invention  and  this  may  be  done  by  any  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  fact.

(D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10930	(E) The examiner should maintain the rejection and inform Smith and Jones that the declarations  are  insufficient  because  they  cannot  “swear  behind”  a  reference  which is a statutory bar. 	988	f	30.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  (8th  Ed.)  §  715.07,  under  the  heading  “Facts  and  Documentary  Evidence”  states  that  “The  essential  thing  to  be  shown  under  37  CFR  1.131  is  priority  of  invention  and  this  may  be  done  by  any  satisfactory  evidence  of  the  fact.

(D) is wrong because an original copy of the published figure which shows that Smith and Jones were not in possession of the claimed invention prior to Bell and Watson publication cannot help their case.  (E) is incorrect because prior art under 102(a) is not a statutory bar. 
10931	(A) An oath or declaration executed by applicant pursuant to 37 CFR 1.63. 	989	t	31.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01As provided in 37 CFR § 1.53(f) and MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is  granted  on  the  date  on  which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the  Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date.
10932	(B) A specification as prescribed by the first paragraph of 35 USC 112.	989	f	31.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01As provided in 37 CFR § 1.53(f) and MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is  granted  on  the  date  on  which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the  Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date.
10933	(C) A description pursuant to 37 CFR 1.71. 	989	f	31.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01As provided in 37 CFR § 1.53(f) and MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is  granted  on  the  date  on  which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the  Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date.
10934	(D) At least one claim pursuant to 37 CFR 1.75. 	989	f	31.  ANSWER:   (A)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  111;  37  CFR  §  1.53;  MPEP  § 601.01As provided in 37 CFR § 1.53(f) and MPEP § 601.01(a), the oath or declaration for an application filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b) can be submitted after the filing date.  (B), (C), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 37 CFR § 53(b); MPEP § 601.01.  37 CFR § 1.53(b) provides that a filing date is  granted  on  the  date  on  which  a  specification  as  prescribed  by  35  U.S.C.  §  112  containing  a  description  pursuant  to  §  1.71  and  at  least  one  claim  pursuant  to  §  1.75,  and  any  drawing  required by § 1.81(a) are filed in the  Office.  Thus, (B), (C), (D) and (E) are needed to obtain a filing date.
10941	(A) The examiner cannot rely on admitted prior art. 	991	f	33.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §§  2141,  2142,  2143  and  2143.01.      Regarding  (C)  MPEP  2142  under  the  heading  “ESTABLISHING  A  PRIMA  FACIE  CASE  OF  OBVIOUSNESS,”  states  “To  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness,  three  basic  criteria  must  be  met.  First,  there  must  be  some  suggestion  or  motivation,  either  in  the  references  themselves or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the reference or to combine reference teachings. Second, there must be a reasonable expectation of success. Finally, the prior art reference (or references when combined) must teach or suggest all  the  claim  limitations.  The  teaching  or  suggestion  to  make  the  claimed  combination  and  the  reasonable  expectation  of  success  must  both  be  found  in  the  prior  art,  and  not  based  on  applicant’s disclosure. In re Vaeck, 947 F.2d 488, 20 USPQ2d 1438 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See MPEP § 2143  for decisions pertinent to each of these criteria.” MPEP § 2143 states the same criteria, and  further  “The  teaching  or  suggestion  to  make  the  claimed  combination  and  the  reasonable  expectation  of  success  must  both  be  found  in  the  prior  art,  not  in  applicant's  disclosure.  In  re  Vaeck,  947  F.2d  488,  20  USPQ2d  1438  (Fed.  Cir.  1991).”    Regarding  motivation,  MPEP  2143.01 states “Obviousness can only be established by combining or modifying the teachings of the  prior  art  to  produce  the  claimed  invention  where  there  is  some  teaching,  suggestion,  or  motivation  to  do  so  found  either  explicitly  or  implicitly  in  the  references  themselves  or  in  the  knowledge  generally  available  to  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art.  ‘The  test  for  an  implicit  showing  is  what  the  combined  teachings,  knowledge  of  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  and  the  nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.’ In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1370, 55 USPQ2d 1313, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2000). See also In re  Fine,  837  F.2d  1071,  5  USPQ2d  1596  (Fed.  Cir.  1988);  In  re  Jones,  958  F.2d  347,  21  USPQ2d  1941  (Fed.  Cir.  1992).”    The  examiner  has  not  shown  any  suggestion  or  motivation,  either in the prior art or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the known plastic composition.  Regarding (D) MPEP § 2142 states “The examiner bears the  initial  burden  of  factually  supporting  any  prima  facie  conclusion  of  obviousness.  If  the  examiner  does  not  produce  a  prima  facie  case,  the  applicant  is  under  no  obligation  to  submit  evidence  of  nonobviousness.  If,  however,  the  examiner  does  produce  a  prima  facie  case,  the  burden  of  coming  forward  with  evidence  or  arguments  shifts  to  the  applicant  who  may  submit  additional  evidence  of  nonobviousness,  such  as  comparative  test  data  showing  that  the  claimed  invention  possesses  improved  properties  not  expected  by  the  prior  art.”    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer  since  it  addresses  both  issues  raised  by  the  examiner,  obviousness  and  evidence  of  improved  results.  (C)  alone  is  incorrect  inasmuch  as  it  does  not  address  the  examiner’s  comments  regarding  improved  results.    (D)  alone  incorrect  because  it  does  not  address  the  examiner’s  burden  of  presenting  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness.    (A)  is  not  correct.    MPEP  § 2129. Admissions by applicant can be used as prior art.  (B) is not correct. MPEP § 2144. It is not necessary for a finding of obviousness that prior art  be combined for the same advantage or result as applicant. 
10942	(B) The examiner has not shown that the prior art appreciated applicant’s discovery of silica to be a flame retardant. 	991	f	33.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §§  2141,  2142,  2143  and  2143.01.      Regarding  (C)  MPEP  2142  under  the  heading  “ESTABLISHING  A  PRIMA  FACIE  CASE  OF  OBVIOUSNESS,”  states  “To  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness,  three  basic  criteria  must  be  met.

See MPEP § 2143  for decisions pertinent to each of these criteria.” MPEP § 2143 states the same criteria, and  further  “The  teaching  or  suggestion  to  make  the  claimed  combination  and  the  reasonable  expectation  of  success  must  both  be  found  in  the  prior  art,  not  in  applicant's  disclosure.  In  re  Vaeck,  947  F.2d  488,  20  USPQ2d  1438  (Fed.  Cir.  1991).”    Regarding  motivation,  MPEP  2143.01 states “Obviousness can only be established by combining or modifying the teachings of the  prior  art  to  produce  the  claimed  invention  where  there  is  some  teaching,  suggestion,  or  motivation  to  do  so  found  either  explicitly  or  implicitly  in  the  references  themselves  or  in  the  knowledge  generally  available  to  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art.  ‘The  test  for  an  implicit  showing  is  what  the  combined  teachings,  knowledge  of  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  and  the  nature of the problem to be solved as a whole would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art.’ In re Kotzab, 217 F.3d 1365, 1370, 55 USPQ2d 1313, 1317 (Fed.

Cir.  1992).”    The  examiner  has  not  shown  any  suggestion  or  motivation,  either in the prior art or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the known plastic composition.  Regarding (D) MPEP § 2142 states “The examiner bears the  initial  burden  of  factually  supporting  any  prima  facie  conclusion  of  obviousness.  If  the  examiner  does  not  produce  a  prima  facie  case,  the  applicant  is  under  no  obligation  to  submit  evidence  of  nonobviousness.  If,  however,  the  examiner  does  produce  a  prima  facie  case,  the  burden  of  coming  forward  with  evidence  or  arguments  shifts  to  the  applicant  who  may  submit  additional  evidence  of  nonobviousness,  such  as  comparative  test  data  showing  that  the  claimed  invention  possesses  improved  properties  not  expected  by  the  prior  art.”    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer  since  it  addresses  both  issues  raised  by  the  examiner,  obviousness  and  evidence  of  improved  results.  (C)  alone  is  incorrect  inasmuch  as  it  does  not  address  the  examiner’s  comments  regarding  improved  results.    (D)  alone  incorrect  because  it  does  not  address  the  examiner’s  burden  of  presenting  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness.    (A)  is  not  correct.    MPEP  § 2129.

It is not necessary for a finding of obviousness that prior art  be combined for the same advantage or result as applicant. 
10943	(C) The examiner has not made out a prima facie case of obviousness due to lack of motivation  in  the  prior  art  or  in  the  knowledge  generally  available  to  one  of  ordinary skill in the art for adding silica to the known plastic composition. 	991	f	33.  ANSWER:    (E)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §§  2141,  2142,  2143  and  2143.01.

First,  there  must  be  some  suggestion  or  motivation,  either  in  the  references  themselves or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art, to modify the reference or to combine reference teachings. Second, there must be a reasonable expectation of success. Finally, the prior art reference (or references when combined) must teach or suggest all  the  claim  limitations.

10960	(E) None of the above. 	994	t	36. ANSWER:   The correct answer is (E), "None of the above."  (A) is incorrect because the G  patent  is  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(b)  statutory  bar.      See  MPEP  §  715  under  heading  "Situations  Where  37  CFR  1.131  Affidavits  Or  Declarations  Are  Inappropriate,"  states  "(A)  Where  the  reference  publication  date  is  more  than  1  year  prior  to  applicant’s  or  patent  owner’s  effective  filing date.  Such a reference is a  'statutory bar' under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)  as referenced in 37 CFR 1.131(a)(2)."      (B)  is  incorrect  because  37  CFR  §  1.131  expressly  provides  that  prior  invention  may not be established under the rule "if  the rejection is based upon a U.S. patent or U.S. patent  application publication of a pending or patented application to another or others which claims the same  patentable  invention  as  defined  in  37  CFR  1.601(n)."    37  CFR  §  1.131(a)(1).      Regarding  (C),   see   MPEP   §   715,   under   heading   "   Situations   Where   37   CFR   1.131   Affidavits   Or   Declarations Are Inappropriate," which states "(G) Where applicant has clearly admitted on the record that subject matter relied on in the reference is prior art.  In this case, that subject matter may be used as a basis for rejecting his or her claims and may not be overcome by an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.131.  In re Hellsund, 474 F.2d 1307, 177 USPQ 170 (CCPA 1973); In  re  Garfinkel,  437  F.2d  1000,  168  USPQ  659  (CCPA  1971); In re Blout,  333  F.2d  928,  142  USPQ  173  (CCPA  1964);  In  re  Lopresti,  333  F.2d  932,  142  USPQ  177  (CCPA  1964)."      Regarding (D), see MPEP § 715, under heading, " Situations Where 37 CFR 1.131 Affidavits Or Declarations Are Inappropriate," which states "(C) Where the reference is a foreign patent for the same invention to applicant or patent owner or his or her legal representatives or assigns issued prior to the filing date of the domestic application or patent on an application filed more than 12 months prior to the filing date of the domestic application. See 35 U.S.C. 102(d)." 
11075	(E)A  title  in  a  U.S.  application  need  not  be  identical  to  the  corresponding  foreign  filed application. 	1017	f	9.     ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  the  title  needs  to  be  technically  accurate and the limitation is 500 characters, not 10 words. See MPEP § 606.  As to (A), (C) and (D),  see  MPEP  §§  606  and  606.01  on  p.  600-50.    As  to  (E),  the  title  can  be  amended  by  the  examiner.
11076	(A)An amendment of the drawings. 	1018	f	10.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.114(d),  last  sentence.    (A),  (B),  (C), and (E) are not the most correct answers.  Each is recognized as being a “submission” within the scope of 37 C.F.R. § 1.114(c). 
10961	(A)  Explain  that  the  rejection  is  statutorily  improper  because  the  first  paragraph  of  section  112  is  concerned  with  enablement  and  written  description  issues  and  therefore does not support a rejection for lack of utility. 	995	f	37.  ANSWER:    (D)  is  most  correct  answer.  As  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.02,  II,  B,  under  the  heading  “No  Statement  of  Utility  for  the  Claimed  Invention  in  the  Specification  Does  Not  Per Se Negate Utility,” the fact that a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate utility.  This is because a claimed invention may have a well-established utility, and an invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill  in  the  art  would  immediately  appreciate  why  the  invention  is  useful  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  invention  and  (ii)  the  utility  is  specific,  substantial,  and  credible.    In  this  case,  the  declarations  specify  a  specific  substantial  and  credible  utility  and  explain  why  the  declarants  (i.e.,  persons  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art)  would  immediately  appreciate  that  the  applicant’s  claimed  composition  would  possess  this  utility.  (A)  is  incorrect.    A  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  35  U.S.C.  §  101  also  creates  a  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “IV.  Relationship Between 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph, And 35 U.S.C. 101.” (B) is not the most correct  answer.  35  U.S.C.  §  101  (and  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112)  requires  that  the  utility  be  specific.    Therefore,  the  disclosure  of  a  general  utility  such  as  “useful  biological”  properties  does  not  satisfy  this  requirement  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading “I. Specific And Substantial Requirements.”  Response (C) also would not be persuasive since  the  rejection  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  applicant’s  specification  fails  to  identify  any specific   and   substantial   utility   for   the   claimed   composition   or   fails   to   disclose   enough   information  about  the  invention  to  make  its  usefulness  immediately  apparent  to  those  familiar  with  the  technological  field  of  the  invention.    This  is  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01.    The  fact  that the claimed composition has unambiguously proven to be useful for curing a form of cancer previously  thought  to  be  incurable  does  not  negate  these  specification  deficiencies.    That  is,  notwithstanding this unambiguous proof, the fact remains that the applicant’s specification fails to identify any specific and substantial utility for the composition.  Moreover, it is clear that the specification  would  not  make  this  specific  usefulness  immediately  apparent  to  those  familiar  with  the  technological  field  of  the  composition  since  the  cancer  was  previously  thought  to  be  incurable.  Finally, response (E) also would not be persuasive.  Under current USPTO policy and procedure,  the  examiner  is  not  required  to  present  evidence  in  support  of  a  rejection  based  on  lack  of  utility  where,  as  here,  the  specification  does  not  identify  a  specific,  substantial  and  credible utility and does not appear to provide sufficient information such that a well-established utility would be apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the art.  See MPEP § 2107, under the heading “II. Examination Guidelines For The Utility Requirement.” 
10962	(B)  Point  out  that  the  rejection  is  based  on  an  erroneous  finding  by  the  examiner  because  the  specification,  in  fact,  clearly  discloses  that  the  composition  in  question possesses “useful biological” properties. 	995	f	37.  ANSWER:    (D)  is  most  correct  answer.  As  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.02,  II,  B,  under  the  heading  “No  Statement  of  Utility  for  the  Claimed  Invention  in  the  Specification  Does  Not  Per Se Negate Utility,” the fact that a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate utility.  This is because a claimed invention may have a well-established utility, and an invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill  in  the  art  would  immediately  appreciate  why  the  invention  is  useful  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  invention  and  (ii)  the  utility  is  specific,  substantial,  and  credible.    In  this  case,  the  declarations  specify  a  specific  substantial  and  credible  utility  and  explain  why  the  declarants  (i.e.,  persons  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art)  would  immediately  appreciate  that  the  applicant’s  claimed  composition  would  possess  this  utility.  (A)  is  incorrect.    A  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  35  U.S.C.  §  101  also  creates  a  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “IV.  Relationship Between 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph, And 35 U.S.C. 101.” (B) is not the most correct  answer.  35  U.S.C.  §  101  (and  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112)  requires  that  the  utility  be  specific.    Therefore,  the  disclosure  of  a  general  utility  such  as  “useful  biological”  properties  does  not  satisfy  this  requirement  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading “I. Specific And Substantial Requirements.”  Response (C) also would not be persuasive since  the  rejection  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  applicant’s  specification  fails  to  identify  any specific   and   substantial   utility   for   the   claimed   composition   or   fails   to   disclose   enough   information  about  the  invention  to  make  its  usefulness  immediately  apparent  to  those  familiar  with  the  technological  field  of  the  invention.    This  is  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01.    The  fact  that the claimed composition has unambiguously proven to be useful for curing a form of cancer previously  thought  to  be  incurable  does  not  negate  these  specification  deficiencies.

Finally, response (E) also would not be persuasive.  Under current USPTO policy and procedure,  the  examiner  is  not  required  to  present  evidence  in  support  of  a  rejection  based  on  lack  of  utility  where,  as  here,  the  specification  does  not  identify  a  specific,  substantial  and  credible utility and does not appear to provide sufficient information such that a well-established utility would be apparent to a person with ordinary skill in the art.  See MPEP § 2107, under the heading “II. Examination Guidelines For The Utility Requirement.” 
10963	(C) Show that the rejection is improper by filing probative evidence that the claimed composition has unambiguously proven to be useful for shrinking a specific class of tumors.	995	f	37.  ANSWER:    (D)  is  most  correct  answer.  As  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.02,  II,  B,  under  the  heading  “No  Statement  of  Utility  for  the  Claimed  Invention  in  the  Specification  Does  Not  Per Se Negate Utility,” the fact that a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate utility.

(A)  is  incorrect.    A  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  35  U.S.C.  §  101  also  creates  a  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “IV.

Therefore,  the  disclosure  of  a  general  utility  such  as  “useful  biological”  properties  does  not  satisfy  this  requirement  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading “I.

See MPEP § 2107, under the heading “II. Examination Guidelines For The Utility Requirement.” 
10964	(D)  File  declarations  by  persons  with  ordinary  skill  in  the  art  stating  that  they  would  immediately  appreciate  that  the  claimed  composition  is  useful  for  shrinking  a  specific class of tumors due to the fact that similar compositions having the same characteristics as applicant’s claimed composition were known to be effective for this purpose.	995	t	37.  ANSWER:    (D)  is  most  correct  answer.  As  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.02,  II,  B,  under  the  heading  “No  Statement  of  Utility  for  the  Claimed  Invention  in  the  Specification  Does  Not  Per Se Negate Utility,” the fact that a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate utility.

(A)  is  incorrect.    A  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  35  U.S.C.  §  101  also  creates  a  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “IV.

10965	(E)  Argue  that  the  rejection  is  improper  because  the  examiner  has  failed  to  present  evidence in support of his position that the claimed composition has no utility. 	995	f	37.  ANSWER:    (D)  is  most  correct  answer.  As  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.02,  II,  B,  under  the  heading  “No  Statement  of  Utility  for  the  Claimed  Invention  in  the  Specification  Does  Not  Per Se Negate Utility,” the fact that a specification does not contain a statement of utility for the claimed invention does not per se negate utility.  This is because a claimed invention may have a well-established utility, and an invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill  in  the  art  would  immediately  appreciate  why  the  invention  is  useful  based  on  the  characteristics  of  the  invention  and  (ii)  the  utility  is  specific,  substantial,  and  credible.    In  this  case,  the  declarations  specify  a  specific  substantial  and  credible  utility  and  explain  why  the  declarants  (i.e.,  persons  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art)  would  immediately  appreciate  that  the  applicant’s  claimed  composition  would  possess  this  utility.  (A)  is  incorrect.    A  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  35  U.S.C.  §  101  also  creates  a  lack  of  utility  deficiency  under  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading  “IV.  Relationship Between 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph, And 35 U.S.C. 101.” (B) is not the most correct  answer.  35  U.S.C.  §  101  (and  the  first  paragraph  of  35  U.S.C.  §  112)  requires  that  the  utility  be  specific.    Therefore,  the  disclosure  of  a  general  utility  such  as  “useful  biological”  properties  does  not  satisfy  this  requirement  as  fully  explained  at  MPEP  §  2107.01,  under  the  heading “I.

10967	(B) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the  assignee,  and  confirm  that  USPTO’s  bibliographic  data  for  application  B  identifies  XYZ  Company  as  the  assignee  by  checking  the  filing  receipt  for  application B, the U.S. application publication of application B, or the USPTO’s Patent  Application  Information  Retrieval  (PAIR)  system  data  for  application  B,  depending on when the practitioner filed the assignment document in application B. 	996	f	38. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In  the  case  of  a  division  or  continuation  application,  a  prior  assignment  recorded  against  the  original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to  both  applications.”  MPEP  §  307  states,  “Irrespective  of  whether  the  assignee  participates  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  the  patent  issues  to  the  assignee  if  so  indicated  on  the  Issue  Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B. Unless an assignee's name and address are identified in item 3 of the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to the applicant. Assignment data  printed  on  the  patent  will  be  based  solely  on  the  information  so  supplied.”  A  new  assignment document need not be recorded for a divisional or continuation application where the assignment recorded in the parent application remains the same.  Accordingly, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address  are  identified  in  item  3  of  PTOL-85B,  the  patent  will  issued  to  the  applicant  and  the  assignee  information,  even  if  recorded,  will  not  appear  on  the  patent.    (C)  is  incorrect  for  the  same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent  application  publication  when  applicant  includes  assignment  information  for  purposes  of  publication  of  the  application  on  the  transmittal  letter.    Assignment  data  printed  on  the  patent  will be based solely on the information supplied on the Issue Fee Transmittal Form PTOL-85B.  See MPEP §§ 1309 and 1481.  Accordingly, (E) is correct and (C) is incorrect.
10968	(C) Confirm that XYZ Company is identified as the assignee on the U.S. application publication of application B.	996	f	38. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 306 and 307.

Accordingly, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address  are  identified  in  item  3  of  PTOL-85B,  the  patent  will  issued  to  the  applicant  and  the  assignee  information,  even  if  recorded,  will  not  appear  on  the  patent.    (C)  is  incorrect  for  the  same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent  application  publication  when  applicant  includes  assignment  information  for  purposes  of  publication  of  the  application  on  the  transmittal  letter.

Accordingly, (E) is correct and (C) is incorrect.
10969	(D) File a proper assignment document in application B identifying XYZ Company as the assignee, and confirm that XYZ Company is identified as the assignee on the U.S. application publication of application B.	996	f	38. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 306 and 307.  MPEP § 306 states, “In  the  case  of  a  division  or  continuation  application,  a  prior  assignment  recorded  against  the  original application is applied to the division or continuation application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the assignee rights to the subject matter common to  both  applications.”  MPEP  §  307  states,  “Irrespective  of  whether  the  assignee  participates  in  the  prosecution  of  the  application,  the  patent  issues  to  the  assignee  if  so  indicated  on  the  Issue  Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B. Unless an assignee's name and address are identified in item 3 of the Issue Fee Transmittal form PTOL-85B, the patent will issue to the applicant. Assignment data  printed  on  the  patent  will  be  based  solely  on  the  information  so  supplied.”  A  new  assignment document need not be recorded for a divisional or continuation application where the assignment recorded in the parent application remains the same.  Accordingly, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect.  In addition, (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect because unless an assignee’s name and address  are  identified  in  item  3  of  PTOL-85B,  the  patent  will  issued  to  the  applicant  and  the  assignee  information,  even  if  recorded,  will  not  appear  on  the  patent.    (C)  is  incorrect  for  the  same reason.  (B) is also incorrect.  Assignment data is reflected on the filing receipt, PAIR, or a patent  application  publication  when  applicant  includes  assignment  information  for  purposes  of  publication  of  the  application  on  the  transmittal  letter.

Accordingly, (E) is correct and (C) is incorrect.
10970	(E) Upon allowance of application B, the practitioner must identify XYZ Company as the  assignee  in  the  appropriate  space  on  the  Issue  Fee  Transmittal  form  for  specifying the assignee for application B. 	996	t	38. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer. MPEP §§ 306 and 307.

Because  in  the  above  fact  pattern,  the  international  application  designated  the  United  States  and  was  published  in  English,  and  was  filed  on  or  after  November  29,  2000,  the  USPTO  published  application  is  entitled to its international filing date of January 5, 2001 for prior art purposes under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e)(1).  See Example 4 of MPEP § 706.02(f)(1).  (A) is wrong because the Japanese filing date is relevant under 35 U.S.C. § 119(a) only for priority and not prior art purposes.  (C) and (E) are  wrong  because  they  recite  prior  art  dates  that  are  later  than  January  5,  2001.

10984	(D) Applicant’s reply distinctly points out detailed reasons why applicant believes the examiner  erred  in  requiring  a  restriction  between  Group  1  and  Group  2,  and  additionally  sets  forth,  “Applicant  therefore  respectfully  traverses  the  restriction  requirement and elects Group 2.	999	t	41. ANSWER:   (D) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.111(b); MPEP §§ 818.03(a)-(c).  MPEP  §  818.03(a)  states  “[a]s  shown  by  the  first  sentence  of  37  CFR  1.143,  the  traverse  to  a  requirement must be complete as required by 37 CFR 1.111(b) . . . Under this rule, the applicant is required to specifically point out the reasons on which he or she bases his or her conclusions that  a  requirement  to  restrict  is  in  error.”    An  election  must  be  made  even  if  the  requirement  is  traversed.    MPEP  §  818.03(b).    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect  since  the  traversal  does  not  distinctly  point out the supposed errors in the examiner’s action, and no election is made. 37 CFR § 1.143.  MPEP  §  818.03(a)  states  “[a]  mere  broad  allegation  that  the  requirement  is  in  error  does  not  comply  with  the  requirement  of  37  CFR  1.111.”    Answer  (A)  is  also  incorrect  because  no  election is made.  MPEP § 818.03(b) states, “[a]s noted in the second sentence of 37 CFR 1.143, a  provisional  election  must  be  made  even  though  the  requirement  is  traversed.  (B)  is  incorrect.

10986	(A) The Board will affirm the rejection based on Smith and Jones only. 	1000	f	42. ANSWER:   (C) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.193(a)(2); MPEP § 1208.01.  If the claimed invention is rendered obvious by Smith in view of Jones and Brown, the statement of rejection  must  include  all  three  references.    Reliance  on  Brown  to  support  the  rejection  is  a  different rejection from a rejection relying only on Smith in view of Jones.   In accordance with MPEP § 1208.01, the Board will not consider the teachings of Brown because Brown was used to support the rejection, but was not listed in the statement of the rejection.  As stated in MPEP § 1208.01, “Even if the prior art reference is cited to support the rejection in a minor capacity, it should be positively included in the statement of rejection. In re Hoch, 428 F.2d 1341, 1342 n.3, 166  USPQ  406,  407  n.3  (CCPA  1970).”    Therefore,  (B)  and  (D)  are  clearly  wrong.  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  decision  cannot  affirm  the  rejection  since  there  is  no  motivation  for  combining  the teachings of Smith and Jones absent the teachings of Brown. Therefore, the rejection must be reversed, not affirmed.

(A)  is  incorrect  because  an  ADS  is  a  voluntary  submission  in  either  a  provisional  application  or  a  nonprovisional  application.    See  37  CFR  1.76(a).    (B)  is  an  incorrect  answer  because  the  information related to the naming of inventors 37 CFR § 1.41(a)(1) and the information relating to setting forth citizenship 35 U.S.C. § 115 is governed by the oath or declaration filed under 37 CFR  §§  1.63  or  1.67  regardless  if  the  two  documents  are  filed  simultaneously.    (C)  is  an  incorrect  answer  because  the  ADS  will  govern  an  inconsistency  concerning  the  claiming  of  domestic priority information.  See 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(2).  (D) is an incorrect answer because the information related to the naming of inventors 37 CFR § 1.41(a)(1) and the information relating to setting forth citizenship 35 U.S.C. § 115 is governed by the oath or declaration filed under 37 CFR  §§  1.63  or  1.67  regardless  of  whether  or  not  the  ADS  is  filed  after  the  oath  or  declaration  under 37 CFR §§ 1.63 or 1.67. 
10992	(B) If an ADS is filed at the same time as an oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 or 1.67  and  the  information  supplied  in  the  two  documents  is  inconsistent,  the  information provided in the ADS will always govern.	1001	f	43.

10996	(A) A claim having the transition term “comprising” is limited to only the limitations, elements or steps recited in the claim, and is not inclusive or open-ended of other unrecited elements or steps. 	1002	f	44.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2111.03  (fourth  paragraph)  states,  in reliance upon In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976), that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or  steps  ‘and  those  that  do  not  materially  affect  the  basic  and  novel  characteristic(s)’  of  the  claimed invention.”  (A) is incorrect.  The statement is contradicted by MPEP § 2111.03 (second paragraph), which states, in reliance upon Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp., 112, F.3d 495, 501, 42  USPQ2d  1608,  1613  (Fed.  Cir.  1997)  that  “[t]he  transition  term  ‘comprising’,  which  is  synonymous with ‘including,’ ‘containing,’ or ‘characterized by,’ is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.  (C) is incorrect.  The statement is contradicted by MPEP § 2111.03 (third paragraph), which states, in reliance upon In re Gray, 53 F.2d 520, 11 USPQ 255 (CCPA 1931) that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting of’ excludes any element, step , or ingredient not specified in the claim.”  (D) is incorrect.  The statement is directly  contradicted  by  MPEP  §  2111.03  (third  paragraph),  which  states  “[a]  claim  which  depends from a claim which ‘consists of’ the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.”  (E) is incorrect because (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect. 
10997	(B)  The  transition  term  “consisting  essentially  of”  limits  the  claim  to  the  limitations  recited  in  the  claim  and  additional  elements  or  steps  which  do  not  materially  affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed invention. 	1002	t	44.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2111.03  (fourth  paragraph)  states,  in reliance upon In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976), that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or  steps  ‘and  those  that  do  not  materially  affect  the  basic  and  novel  characteristic(s)’  of  the  claimed invention.”  (A) is incorrect.  The statement is contradicted by MPEP § 2111.03 (second paragraph), which states, in reliance upon Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp., 112, F.3d 495, 501, 42  USPQ2d  1608,  1613  (Fed.  Cir.  1997)  that  “[t]he  transition  term  ‘comprising’,  which  is  synonymous with ‘including,’ ‘containing,’ or ‘characterized by,’ is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps.  (C) is incorrect.  The statement is contradicted by MPEP § 2111.03 (third paragraph), which states, in reliance upon In re Gray, 53 F.2d 520, 11 USPQ 255 (CCPA 1931) that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting of’ excludes any element, step , or ingredient not specified in the claim.”  (D) is incorrect.  The statement is directly  contradicted  by  MPEP  §  2111.03  (third  paragraph),  which  states  “[a]  claim  which  depends from a claim which ‘consists of’ the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.”  (E) is incorrect because (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect. 
11042	(B)  A  claim  may  include  plural  indentations  to  further  segregate  subcombinations  or  related steps.   	1011	f	3.    ANSWER:  (E).   There is no such requirement.  As to (C), see 37 C.F.R. § 1.52(b).   As to (A) through (D) see MPEP § 608.01(m).  37 C.F.R. § 1.75(i). 
11043	(C)  The  claim  or  claims  must  commence  on  a  separate  sheet  after  the  detailed  description of the invention.	1011	f	3.    ANSWER:  (E).   There is no such requirement.  As to (C), see 37 C.F.R. § 1.52(b).   As to (A) through (D) see MPEP § 608.01(m).  37 C.F.R. § 1.75(i). 
11044	(D)Each claim should end with a period.	1011	f	3.    ANSWER:  (E).   There is no such requirement.  As to (C), see 37 C.F.R. § 1.52(b).   As to (A) through (D) see MPEP § 608.01(m).  37 C.F.R. § 1.75(i). 
10998	(C) A claim having the transition term “consisting of” is not limited to the elements or steps  recited  in  the  claim,  but  can  include  elements  or  steps  other  than  those  recited in addition to any impurities ordinarily associated therewith.	1002	f	44.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2111.03  (fourth  paragraph)  states,  in reliance upon In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976), that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or  steps  ‘and  those  that  do  not  materially  affect  the  basic  and  novel  characteristic(s)’  of  the  claimed invention.”  (A) is incorrect.

The statement is directly  contradicted  by  MPEP  §  2111.03  (third  paragraph),  which  states  “[a]  claim  which  depends from a claim which ‘consists of’ the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.”  (E) is incorrect because (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect. 
10999	(D)  A  claim  which  depends  from  a  claim  which  claims  an  invention  “consisting  of”  the  recited  elements  or  steps  can  add  an  element  or  step  to  further  limit  the  claimed invention. 	1002	f	44.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2111.03  (fourth  paragraph)  states,  in reliance upon In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976), that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or  steps  ‘and  those  that  do  not  materially  affect  the  basic  and  novel  characteristic(s)’  of  the  claimed invention.”  (A) is incorrect.

11000	(E) All of the above.	1002	f	44.  ANSWER:    (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2111.03  (fourth  paragraph)  states,  in reliance upon In re Herz, 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976), that “[t]he transitional phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or  steps  ‘and  those  that  do  not  materially  affect  the  basic  and  novel  characteristic(s)’  of  the  claimed invention.”  (A) is incorrect.

11001	(A) The Board must consider each of claims 1-10 separately on the merits. 	1003	f	45. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7); MPEP § 1206, under the  heading  “Appeal  Brief  Content,”  subheading  “(7)  Grouping  of  Claims.”  37  CFR  §  1.192(c)(7) requires that an appellant perform two affirmative acts in the brief to receive separate consideration  of  the  patentability  of  a  plurality  of  claims  that  are  subject  to  the  same  rejection.    The  appellant  must  (1)  state  that  the  claims  do  not  stand  or  fall  together  and  (2)  present  arguments  why  the  claims  subject  to  the  same  rejection  are  separately  patentable.    Since  the  appellant  here  has  only  performed  the  two  affirmative  acts  with  respect  to  claims  1,  4  and  6,  these are the claims that the Board must consider separately for patentability.  The examiner has no  input  on  the  grouping  of  claims.    (D)  is  incorrect  inasmuch  as  §  1.192(c)(7)  requires  the  inclusion  of  reasons  in  order  to  avoid  unsupported  assertions  of  separate  patentability.    See  MPEP § 1206, subheading subheading “(7) Grouping of Claims.” Where the grouping of claims section is inconsistent with the arguments section as in the facts of this case, the examiner should have notified the appellant that the brief was in noncompliance as per 37 CFR § 1.192(d).

However, failure of the examiner to note noncompliance does not require  the  Board  to  separately  consider  claims  which  have  not  been  specifically  argued  in  the  brief.  (A) is incorrect inasmuch as the two affirmative acts required by § 1.192(c)(7) to have the separate  patentability  of  a  plurality  of  claims  subject  to  the  same  rejection  considered,  i.e.,  (1)  state  that  the  claims  do  not  stand  or  fall  together  and  (2)  present  arguments  why  the  claims  subject  to  the  same  rejection  are  separately  patentable,  have  not  been  presented  for  each  of  claims 1-10.   (C) is are incorrect because the provisions of § 1.192(c)(7) have been satisfied for claims 1, 4 and 6. (E) is wrong because the provisions of § 1.192(c)(7) have been satisfied. (A), (C) and (D) are incorrect answers.

11004	(D)  The  Board  must  consider  claim  1  and  claim  7  separately  on  the  merits  as  representative of all the claims on appeal.	1003	f	45. ANSWER:   (B) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.192(c)(7); MPEP § 1206, under the  heading  “Appeal  Brief  Content,”  subheading  “(7)  Grouping  of  Claims.”  37  CFR  §  1.192(c)(7) requires that an appellant perform two affirmative acts in the brief to receive separate consideration  of  the  patentability  of  a  plurality  of  claims  that  are  subject  to  the  same  rejection.

(C) is are incorrect because the provisions of § 1.192(c)(7) have been satisfied for claims 1, 4 and 6. (E) is wrong because the provisions of § 1.192(c)(7) have been satisfied. (A), (C) and (D) are incorrect answers. 
11006	(A) The examiner should allow the claim. 	1004	f	46. ANSWER:   (C) is the best answer.  35 U.S.C. § 102; MPEP §§ 2111 and 2131.  MPEP § 2131, under the heading, “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim.” "A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found,  either  expressly  or  inherently  described,  in  a  single  prior  art  reference."  See  Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987).  Here,  every  element  of  the  claim  is  found  in  Patent  A.  See  MPEP  2111,  under  the  heading  “Claims  Must  Be  Given  Their  Broadest  Reasonable  Interpretation,”  where  it  explained  that  “[d]uring  patent  examination,  the  pending  claims  must  be  ‘given  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation consistent with the specification,” and cites In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162  USPQ  541,  550-51  (CCPA  1969)  to  explain  that  "reading  a  claim  in  light  of  the  specification,  to  thereby  interpret  limitations  explicitly  recited  in  the  claim,  is  a  quite  different  thing from 'reading limitations of the specification into a claim,' to thereby narrow the scope of the  claim  by  implicitly  adding  disclosed  limitations  which  have  no  express  basis  in  the  claim."  (A) and (B) are incorrect.  MPEP § 2111.  The claim, as written, is not allowable over Patent A since Patent A disclosed every element recited in the claim.  (D) is incorrect. There is no need to search  again  for  a  building  material,  this  time  looking  for  balsa  wood.  The  claim  has  not  been  amended  to  be  directed  to  balsa  wood.  Since  it  still  broadly  recites  “wood,”  Patent  A  that  discloses  pine  remains  germane  and  anticipates  the  claim.    (E)  is  incorrect  for  one  or  more  reasons. It is incorrect because it wrongly agrees with the practitioner’s argument that Patent A is poor  reference.    It  also  is  incorrect  because  it  seeks  to  reject  the  claim  over  35  U.S.C.  §  112,  second paragraph, for indefiniteness. The claim is clear on its face and there is nothing indefinite about   what   the   claim   says.   This   answer   makes   the   mistake   of   confusing   breadth   with   indefiniteness. The claim is broad but it is definite. 
11007	(B)   The   examiner   should   allow   the   claim   only   after   including   a   Reasons   for   Allowance  pointing  out  that  the  inventor  argues  that  her  invention  is  directed  to  using balsa wood, not pine. 	1004	f	46. ANSWER:   (C) is the best answer.  35 U.S.C. § 102; MPEP §§ 2111 and 2131.  MPEP § 2131, under the heading, “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim.” "A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found,  either  expressly  or  inherently  described,  in  a  single  prior  art  reference."  See  Verdegaal Bros. v. Union Oil Co. of California, 814 F.2d 628, 631, 2 USPQ2d 1051, 1053 (Fed. Cir. 1987).  Here,  every  element  of  the  claim  is  found  in  Patent  A.  See  MPEP  2111,  under  the  heading  “Claims  Must  Be  Given  Their  Broadest  Reasonable  Interpretation,”  where  it  explained  that  “[d]uring  patent  examination,  the  pending  claims  must  be  ‘given  the  broadest  reasonable  interpretation consistent with the specification,” and cites In re Prater, 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162  USPQ  541,  550-51  (CCPA  1969)  to  explain  that  "reading  a  claim  in  light  of  the  specification,  to  thereby  interpret  limitations  explicitly  recited  in  the  claim,  is  a  quite  different  thing from 'reading limitations of the specification into a claim,' to thereby narrow the scope of the  claim  by  implicitly  adding  disclosed  limitations  which  have  no  express  basis  in  the  claim."  (A) and (B) are incorrect.  MPEP § 2111.  The claim, as written, is not allowable over Patent A since Patent A disclosed every element recited in the claim.  (D) is incorrect. There is no need to search  again  for  a  building  material,  this  time  looking  for  balsa  wood.  The  claim  has  not  been  amended  to  be  directed  to  balsa  wood.  Since  it  still  broadly  recites  “wood,”  Patent  A  that  discloses  pine  remains  germane  and  anticipates  the  claim.    (E)  is  incorrect  for  one  or  more  reasons. It is incorrect because it wrongly agrees with the practitioner’s argument that Patent A is poor  reference.    It  also  is  incorrect  because  it  seeks  to  reject  the  claim  over  35  U.S.C.  §  112,  second paragraph, for indefiniteness. The claim is clear on its face and there is nothing indefinite about   what   the   claim   says.   This   answer   makes   the   mistake   of   confusing   breadth   with   indefiniteness. The claim is broad but it is definite. 
11046	(A)Claim 2. The doughnut making machine of Claim 1, wherein said placing meansis a conveyor that extends from said applying means to said flat sheet. 	1012	f	4.    ANSWER:  The most correct answer is (E).  A dependent claim must further limit the claim from which it depends.  35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶4; 37 C.F.R. § 1.75(c).  Dependent claim 6 (Answer E) improperly seeks to broaden Claim 1 by omitting an element set forth in the parent claim. 
11008	(C)  The  examiner  should  issue  a  Final  Rejection  again  rejecting  the  claim  as  anticipated under 35 USC102 over Patent A. 	1004	t	46.

11009	(D) The examiner should reopen prosecution and begin anew, this time searching for a reference that shows a building material containing balsa wood. 	1004	f	46. ANSWER:   (C) is the best answer.  35 U.S.C. § 102; MPEP §§ 2111 and 2131.

11010	(E)  The  examiner  should  withdraw  the  rejection  but  issue  a  new  Office  action  this  time rejecting the claim under 35 USC 112, second paragraph, because the claim is broad enough to encompass using pine. 	1004	f	46. ANSWER:   (C) is the best answer.  35 U.S.C. § 102; MPEP §§ 2111 and 2131.  MPEP § 2131, under the heading, “To Anticipate A Claim, The Reference Must Teach Every Element Of The Claim.” "A claim is anticipated only if each and every element as set forth in the claim is found,  either  expressly  or  inherently  described,  in  a  single  prior  art  reference."

11011	(A) must be known or used in NAFTA or WTO member countries.	1005	f	47.  ANSWER:    (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(a);  MPEP  §  2132.    As  set  forth in MPEP § 2132, under the heading “II. ‘In This Country,’” subheading “Only Knowledge or Use In The U.S. Can Be Used in a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) Rejection,” states “[t]he knowledge or use relied  on  in  a  35  U.S.C.  102(a)  rejection  must  be  knowledge  or  use  ‘in  this  country.’    Prior  knowledge  or  use  which  is  not  present  in  the  United  States,  even  if  widespread  in  a  foreign  country,  cannot  be  the  basis  of  a  rejection  under  35  U.S.C.  102(a).    In  re  Ekenstam,  256  F.2d  321,  118  USPQ  349  (CCPA  1958).    Note  that  the  changes  made  to  35  U.S.C.104  by  NAFTA  (Public Law 103-182) and Uruguay Round Agreements Act (Public Law 103-465) do not modify the meaning of ‘in this country’ as used in 35 U.S.C. 102(a) and thus ‘in this country” still means in the United States for purposes of 35 U.S.C. 102(a) rejections.’”  See also MPEP § 706.02(c), “[t]he  language  ‘in  this  country’  means  in  the  United  States  only  and  does  not  include  other WTO  or  NAFTA  member  countries.”  Since  “in  this  country”  means  in  the  United  States  for  purposes of 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) rejections, (A), (B), (D) and (E) are incorrect. 
11017	(B) A status inquiry 6 months after filing the petition. 	1006	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.181(f);  MPEP  §§  714.13  and  1002:  37  CFR  §  1.181(f)  provides  "The  mere  filing  of  a  petition  will  not  stay  the  period  for  reply  to  an  Examiner's  action  which  may  be  running  against  an  application,  nor  act  as  a  stay  of  other  proceedings."    MPEP  §§  714.13  states  “[i]t  should  be  noted  that  under  37  CFR  1.181(f),  the  filing of a 37 CFR 1.181 petition will not stay the period for reply to an examiner's action which may  be  running  against  an  application.”  See  also  MPEP  §  1002.  Thus,  if  a  petition  to  vacate  a  final  rejection  as  premature  is  filed  within  2  months  from  the  date  of  the  final  rejection,  the  period  for  reply  to  the  final  rejection  is  not  extended  even  if  the  petition  is  not  reached  for  decision  within  that  period.  However,  if  the  petition  is  granted  and  the  applicant  has  filed  an  otherwise full reply to the rejection within the period for reply, the case is not abandoned.  (C) is correct because the petition does not stay the time for responding to the final and a reply should be  filed  within  the  shortened  statutory  period  to  avoid  fees.    (A)  is  incorrect  because  any  reply  after the shorted statutory period set for reply in the final rejection will require at least payment of fees for an extension of time.  MPEP § 1002 states “The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner's action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (37 CFR 1.181(f)). For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period.” (B) is incorrect because the application will be abandoned 6 months after the date of the final rejection for lack of reply to the final rejection, 35 U.S.C. 133, and a status inquiry filed 6  months  after  filing  the  petition    would  be  in  an  abandoned  application.    Moreover,  a  petition  status  inquiry  filed  at  any  time  is  not  a  proper  reply  to  the  final  rejection.    See  37  CFR  §§ 1.113(c) and 1.116.  (D) is incorrect because the filing of a petition does not stay the period for reply.  37 CFR § 1.181(f); MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1002.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct, and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11012	(B) must be known or used in a NAFTA member country, but only if the filing date of the  application  is  after  the  effective  date  of  the  North  American  Free  Trade  Agreement Implementation Act. 	1005	f	47.  ANSWER:    (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(a);  MPEP  §  2132.    As  set  forth in MPEP § 2132, under the heading “II. ‘In This Country,’” subheading “Only Knowledge or Use In The U.S. Can Be Used in a 35 U.S.C. 102(a) Rejection,” states “[t]he knowledge or use relied  on  in  a  35  U.S.C.  102(a)  rejection  must  be  knowledge  or  use  ‘in  this  country.’    Prior  knowledge  or  use  which  is  not  present  in  the  United  States,  even  if  widespread  in  a  foreign  country,  cannot  be  the  basis  of  a  rejection  under  35  U.S.C.  102(a).

11014	(D) can be known or used in any country. 	1005	f	47.  ANSWER:    (C)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    35  U.S.C.  §  102(a);  MPEP  §  2132.

11016	(A) A reply to the final rejection within 6 months. 	1006	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.181(f);  MPEP  §§  714.13  and  1002:  37  CFR  §  1.181(f)  provides  "The  mere  filing  of  a  petition  will  not  stay  the  period  for  reply  to  an  Examiner's  action  which  may  be  running  against  an  application,  nor  act  as  a  stay  of  other  proceedings."    MPEP  §§  714.13  states  “[i]t  should  be  noted  that  under  37  CFR  1.181(f),  the  filing of a 37 CFR 1.181 petition will not stay the period for reply to an examiner's action which may  be  running  against  an  application.”  See  also  MPEP  §  1002.  Thus,  if  a  petition  to  vacate  a  final  rejection  as  premature  is  filed  within  2  months  from  the  date  of  the  final  rejection,  the  period  for  reply  to  the  final  rejection  is  not  extended  even  if  the  petition  is  not  reached  for  decision  within  that  period.  However,  if  the  petition  is  granted  and  the  applicant  has  filed  an  otherwise full reply to the rejection within the period for reply, the case is not abandoned.  (C) is correct because the petition does not stay the time for responding to the final and a reply should be  filed  within  the  shortened  statutory  period  to  avoid  fees.    (A)  is  incorrect  because  any  reply  after the shorted statutory period set for reply in the final rejection will require at least payment of fees for an extension of time.  MPEP § 1002 states “The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner's action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (37 CFR 1.181(f)). For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period.” (B) is incorrect because the application will be abandoned 6 months after the date of the final rejection for lack of reply to the final rejection, 35 U.S.C. 133, and a status inquiry filed 6  months  after  filing  the  petition    would  be  in  an  abandoned  application.    Moreover,  a  petition  status  inquiry  filed  at  any  time  is  not  a  proper  reply  to  the  final  rejection.    See  37  CFR  §§ 1.113(c) and 1.116.  (D) is incorrect because the filing of a petition does not stay the period for reply.  37 CFR § 1.181(f); MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1002.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct, and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11047	(B) Claim 3. The doughnut making machine of Claim 1, wherein said forming meansincludes a cutter that removes a center portion of each of said dough balls to forma ring of dough.	1012	f	4.    ANSWER:  The most correct answer is (E).  A dependent claim must further limit the claim from which it depends.  35 U.S.C. § 112, ¶4; 37 C.F.R. § 1.75(c).  Dependent claim 6 (Answer E) improperly seeks to broaden Claim 1 by omitting an element set forth in the parent claim. 
11853	(E) The petition is accompanied by applicant’s statement explaining how the invention contributes to the diagnosis, treatment or prevention of HIV/AIDS or cancer.	1181	f	see MPEP 708.02
11018	(C)  A  reply  to  the  final  rejection  within  the  shortened  statutory  time  period  set  for  reply in the final rejection. 	1006	t	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.181(f);  MPEP  §§  714.13  and  1002:  37  CFR  §  1.181(f)  provides  "The  mere  filing  of  a  petition  will  not  stay  the  period  for  reply  to  an  Examiner's  action  which  may  be  running  against  an  application,  nor  act  as  a  stay  of  other  proceedings."    MPEP  §§  714.13  states  “[i]t  should  be  noted  that  under  37  CFR  1.181(f),  the  filing of a 37 CFR 1.181 petition will not stay the period for reply to an examiner's action which may  be  running  against  an  application.”  See  also  MPEP  §  1002.  Thus,  if  a  petition  to  vacate  a  final  rejection  as  premature  is  filed  within  2  months  from  the  date  of  the  final  rejection,  the  period  for  reply  to  the  final  rejection  is  not  extended  even  if  the  petition  is  not  reached  for  decision  within  that  period.  However,  if  the  petition  is  granted  and  the  applicant  has  filed  an  otherwise full reply to the rejection within the period for reply, the case is not abandoned.  (C) is correct because the petition does not stay the time for responding to the final and a reply should be  filed  within  the  shortened  statutory  period  to  avoid  fees.    (A)  is  incorrect  because  any  reply  after the shorted statutory period set for reply in the final rejection will require at least payment of fees for an extension of time.  MPEP § 1002 states “The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner's action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (37 CFR 1.181(f)). For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period.” (B) is incorrect because the application will be abandoned 6 months after the date of the final rejection for lack of reply to the final rejection, 35 U.S.C. 133, and a status inquiry filed 6  months  after  filing  the  petition    would  be  in  an  abandoned  application.    Moreover,  a  petition  status  inquiry  filed  at  any  time  is  not  a  proper  reply  to  the  final  rejection.    See  37  CFR  §§ 1.113(c) and 1.116.  (D) is incorrect because the filing of a petition does not stay the period for reply.  37 CFR § 1.181(f); MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1002.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct, and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11019	(D) No reply is necessary until a decision is received on the petition. 	1006	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.181(f);  MPEP  §§  714.13  and  1002:  37  CFR  §  1.181(f)  provides  "The  mere  filing  of  a  petition  will  not  stay  the  period  for  reply  to  an  Examiner's  action  which  may  be  running  against  an  application,  nor  act  as  a  stay  of  other  proceedings."    MPEP  §§  714.13  states  “[i]t  should  be  noted  that  under  37  CFR  1.181(f),  the  filing of a 37 CFR 1.181 petition will not stay the period for reply to an examiner's action which may  be  running  against  an  application.”  See  also  MPEP  §  1002.

For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period.” (B) is incorrect because the application will be abandoned 6 months after the date of the final rejection for lack of reply to the final rejection, 35 U.S.C. 133, and a status inquiry filed 6  months  after  filing  the  petition    would  be  in  an  abandoned  application.    Moreover,  a  petition  status  inquiry  filed  at  any  time  is  not  a  proper  reply  to  the  final  rejection.    See  37  CFR  §§ 1.113(c) and 1.116.  (D) is incorrect because the filing of a petition does not stay the period for reply.  37 CFR § 1.181(f); MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1002.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct, and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11020	(E) All of the above.	1006	f	48.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  correct.    37  CFR  §  1.181(f);  MPEP  §§  714.13  and  1002:  37  CFR  §  1.181(f)  provides  "The  mere  filing  of  a  petition  will  not  stay  the  period  for  reply  to  an  Examiner's  action  which  may  be  running  against  an  application,  nor  act  as  a  stay  of  other  proceedings."

(D) is incorrect because the filing of a petition does not stay the period for reply.  37 CFR § 1.181(f); MPEP §§ 714.13 and 1002.  (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct, and (A), (B) and (D) are incorrect. 
11021	(A)  Claim  9  is  a  proper  independent  claim,  and  Claims  10  and  11  are  proper  dependent claims. 	1007	f	49. ANSWER:   (E) is the most correct answer.  37 CFR § 1.75(c); MPEP § 608.01(n), under the heading “II. Treatment Of Improper Dependent Claims,” 37 CFR § 1.75(c) provides “One or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim  or  claims  in  the  same  application.”    Claim  9,  though  broad,  is  supported  by  the  specification.    The  minimum  memory  recited  in  the  claim  as  original  disclosure,  is  self-supporting. 35 U.S.C. § 112, first paragraph.  See MPEP §§ 608.01(l) and 2163.  Claim 10 is a proper  dependent  claim  because  it  depends  from  and  further  restricts  the  scope  of  a  preceding  claim.    37  CFR  §  1.75(c).    Claim  11  is  an  improper  dependent  claim  because  it  is  inconsistent  with and does not further limit the scope of claim 10.  Claim 10, depending on Claim 9, has a 1 gigabyte  memory  minimum,  whereas  Claim  11  redefines  the  minimum  memory  by  setting  a  lower minimum of ½ gigabyte.

11026	(A) Fact (1) only 	1008	f	50.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct,  as  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(g)  rejection  requires  actual  reduction to practice by another, and lack of abandonment, suppression, or concealment.  MPEP §  2138  states  “35  U.S.C.  102(g)  may  form  the  basis  for  an  ex  parte  rejection  if:  (1)  the  subject  matter at issue has been actually reduced to practice by another before the applicant's invention; and  (2)  there  has  been  no  abandonment,  suppression  or  concealment.  See,  e.g.,  Amgen,  Inc.  v.Chugai  Pharmaceutical  Co.,  927  F.2d  1200,  1205,  18  USPQ2d  1016,  1020  (Fed.  Cir.  1991);  New Idea Farm EquipmentCorp. v.

MPEP  §  2138.    (B)  is  incorrect,  as  abandonment,  suppression,  or  concealment    is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(g)  rejection  where  the  subject  matter  has  been  reduced  to  practice  in  that  conception  alone  is  not  sufficient.  See  Kimberly-Clark  v.  Johnson  &  Johnson,  745  F.2d  1437,  1445,  223  USPQ  603,  607  (Fed.  Cir.  1984).  MPEP  §  2138.    (D)  is  incorrect  because  no  prior  patent  application  is  required  for  a  §  102(g) rejection.  MPEP § 2138.  Similarly, (E) is incorrect, because no prior patent application nor issued patent is required for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g). 
11027	(B) Fact (2) only	1008	f	50.

Sperry Corp., 916 F.2d 1561, 1566, 16 USPQ2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1990); E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 849 F.2d 1430, 1434, 7 USPQ2d 1129, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Kimberly-Clark v. Johnson & Johnson, 745 F.2d 1437, 1444-46,  223  USPQ  603,  606-08  (Fed.  Cir.  1984).”  (A)  is  incorrect,  as  actual  reduction  to  practice is not sufficient to establish a 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) rejection where the subject matter has been  abandoned,  suppressed,  or  concealed.    MPEP  §  2138.    (B)  is  incorrect,  as  abandonment,  suppression,  or  concealment    is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(g)  rejection  where  the  subject  matter  has  been  reduced  to  practice  in  that  conception  alone  is  not  sufficient.  See  Kimberly-Clark  v.  Johnson  &  Johnson,  745  F.2d  1437,  1445,  223  USPQ  603,  607  (Fed.  Cir.  1984).  MPEP  §  2138.    (D)  is  incorrect  because  no  prior  patent  application  is  required  for  a  §  102(g) rejection.  MPEP § 2138.  Similarly, (E) is incorrect, because no prior patent application nor issued patent is required for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g). 
11030	(E) Facts (1), (2), (3) and (4)	1008	f	50.  ANSWER:   (C)  is  the  most  correct,  as  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(g)  rejection  requires  actual  reduction to practice by another, and lack of abandonment, suppression, or concealment.  MPEP §  2138  states  “35  U.S.C.  102(g)  may  form  the  basis  for  an  ex  parte  rejection  if:  (1)  the  subject  matter at issue has been actually reduced to practice by another before the applicant's invention; and  (2)  there  has  been  no  abandonment,  suppression  or  concealment.  See,  e.g.,  Amgen,  Inc.  v.Chugai  Pharmaceutical  Co.,  927  F.2d  1200,  1205,  18  USPQ2d  1016,  1020  (Fed.  Cir.  1991);  New Idea Farm EquipmentCorp. v. Sperry Corp., 916 F.2d 1561, 1566, 16 USPQ2d 1424, 1428 (Fed. Cir. 1990); E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 849 F.2d 1430, 1434, 7 USPQ2d 1129, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1988); Kimberly-Clark v. Johnson & Johnson, 745 F.2d 1437, 1444-46,  223  USPQ  603,  606-08  (Fed.  Cir.  1984).”  (A)  is  incorrect,  as  actual  reduction  to  practice is not sufficient to establish a 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) rejection where the subject matter has been  abandoned,  suppressed,  or  concealed.    MPEP  §  2138.    (B)  is  incorrect,  as  abandonment,  suppression,  or  concealment    is  not  sufficient  to  establish  a  35  U.S.C.  §  102(g)  rejection  where  the  subject  matter  has  been  reduced  to  practice  in  that  conception  alone  is  not  sufficient.  See  Kimberly-Clark  v.  Johnson  &  Johnson,  745  F.2d  1437,  1445,  223  USPQ  603,  607  (Fed.  Cir.  1984).  MPEP  §  2138.    (D)  is  incorrect  because  no  prior  patent  application  is  required  for  a  §  102(g) rejection.  MPEP § 2138.  Similarly, (E) is incorrect, because no prior patent application nor issued patent is required for a rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g).

11061	(A)The examiner may reject the alloy claims on the basis of the prior art publication.	1015	f	7.    ANSWER:  (B)  is  best  choice  because  it  is  a  false  statement.    MPEP  §  2112.01  cites  Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 660. 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985), as stating, “it was  immaterial  what  properties  the  alloys  had...because  the  composition  is  the  same  and  thus  must  necessarily  exhibit  the  properties.”    (A)  is  not  correct  because  it  is  a  true  statement.    (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect  because  the  stated  reliance  is  permitted.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.104(c)(3);  MPEP § 706. 
11062	(B)  The  examiner  may  not  reject  the  alloy  claims  on  the  basis  of  the  prior  art  publication, because the alloys of the application are characterized by unexpected, improved ductility properties. 	1015	t	7.    ANSWER:  (B)  is  best  choice  because  it  is  a  false  statement.    MPEP  §  2112.01  cites  Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 660. 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985), as stating, “it was  immaterial  what  properties  the  alloys  had...because  the  composition  is  the  same  and  thus  must  necessarily  exhibit  the  properties.”    (A)  is  not  correct  because  it  is  a  true  statement.

11065	(E)The examiner, having facts within his or her personal knowledge, may rely on thefacts in rejecting the alloy claims.  	1015	f	7.    ANSWER:  (B)  is  best  choice  because  it  is  a  false  statement.    MPEP  §  2112.01  cites  Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 660. 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985), as stating, “it was  immaterial  what  properties  the  alloys  had...because  the  composition  is  the  same  and  thus  must  necessarily  exhibit  the  properties.”    (A)  is  not  correct  because  it  is  a  true  statement.    (C),  (D)  and  (E)  are  incorrect  because  the  stated  reliance  is  permitted.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.104(c)(3);  MPEP § 706. 
11066	(A)Filing a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit to swear behind the patent on which the rejection is based. 	1016	f	8.    ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.  MPEP  §  804.02,  subpart  (II)  reads,  “A  rejection  based  on  a  nonstatutory  type  of  double  patenting  can  be  avoided  by  filing  a  terminal  disclaimer in the application or proceeding in which the rejection is made.”  Choices (A) and (C) are  each  incorrect.    MPEP  §  804.02,  reads,  “The  use  of  a  37  C.F.R.  §  1.131  affidavit  in  overcoming  a  double  patenting  rejection  is  inappropriate...37  C.F.R.  §  1.131  is  inapplicable  if  the claims of the application and the patent are ‘directed to substantially the same invention.’ It is also  inapplicable  if  there  is  a  lack  of  ‘patentable  distinctness’  between  the  claimed  subject  matter.”  Choice  (C)  is  further  incorrect  since  a  nonstatutory  double  patenting  rejection  can  be  based on the claims not being patentably distinct. MPEP § 804, subpart (II)(B)(1). Choice (D) is incorrect  because  MPEP  §  804,  subpart  (I)(A)  reads,  “Double  patenting  may  exist  between  an  issued  patent  and  an  application  filed  by  the  same  inventive  entity,  or  by  an  inventive  entity  having  a  common  inventor  with  the  patent.”  Choice  (E)  is  incorrect  because  choices  (A),  (C),  and (D) are each incorrect. 
11067	(B) Filing a terminal disclaimer under 37 CFR 1.321(c). 	1016	t	8.    ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.

MPEP § 804, subpart (II)(B)(1). Choice (D) is incorrect  because  MPEP  §  804,  subpart  (I)(A)  reads,  “Double  patenting  may  exist  between  an  issued  patent  and  an  application  filed  by  the  same  inventive  entity,  or  by  an  inventive  entity  having  a  common  inventor  with  the  patent.”  Choice  (E)  is  incorrect  because  choices  (A),  (C),  and (D) are each incorrect. 
11068	(C) Filing a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit arguing that the claims are for different inventions that are not patentably distinct. 	1016	f	8.    ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.  MPEP  §  804.02,  subpart  (II)  reads,  “A  rejection  based  on  a  nonstatutory  type  of  double  patenting  can  be  avoided  by  filing  a  terminal  disclaimer in the application or proceeding in which the rejection is made.”  Choices (A) and (C) are  each  incorrect.

MPEP § 804, subpart (II)(B)(1). Choice (D) is incorrect  because  MPEP  §  804,  subpart  (I)(A)  reads,  “Double  patenting  may  exist  between  an  issued  patent  and  an  application  filed  by  the  same  inventive  entity,  or  by  an  inventive  entity  having  a  common  inventor  with  the  patent.”  Choice  (E)  is  incorrect  because  choices  (A),  (C),  and (D) are each incorrect. 
11069	(D)  Filing  a  reply  arguing  that  there  is  only  one  common  inventor  regarding  the  claims of the application and the claims of the patent. 	1016	f	8.    ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.  MPEP  §  804.02,  subpart  (II)  reads,  “A  rejection  based  on  a  nonstatutory  type  of  double  patenting  can  be  avoided  by  filing  a  terminal  disclaimer in the application or proceeding in which the rejection is made.”  Choices (A) and (C) are  each  incorrect.

11071	(A)The  title  of  the  invention  should  be  placed  at  the  top  of  the  first  page  of  the  specification unless it is provided in the application data sheet.	1017	f	9.     ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  the  title  needs  to  be  technically  accurate and the limitation is 500 characters, not 10 words. See MPEP § 606.  As to (A), (C) and (D),  see  MPEP  §§  606  and  606.01  on  p.  600-50.    As  to  (E),  the  title  can  be  amended  by  the  examiner.
11072	(B)  The  title  need  not  be  technically  accurate,  but  should  be  descriptive  and  shouldcontain fewer than 10 words.  	1017	t	9.     ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  the  title  needs  to  be  technically  accurate and the limitation is 500 characters, not 10 words. See MPEP § 606.  As to (A), (C) and (D),  see  MPEP  §§  606  and  606.01  on  p.  600-50.    As  to  (E),  the  title  can  be  amended  by  the  examiner.
11073	(C) Inasmuch as the words “improved,” “improvement of,” and “improvement in” are not  considered  as  part  of  the  title  of  an  invention,  these  words  should  not  beincluded at the beginning   of the title of the invention and will be deleted when the Office enters the title into the Office’s computer records, and when any patent issues. 	1017	f	9.     ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer  inasmuch  as  the  title  needs  to  be  technically  accurate and the limitation is 500 characters, not 10 words. See MPEP § 606.  As to (A), (C) and (D),  see  MPEP  §§  606  and  606.01  on  p.  600-50.    As  to  (E),  the  title  can  be  amended  by  the  examiner.
11078	(C) New evidence in support of patentability. 	1018	f	10.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.114(d),  last  sentence.    (A),  (B),  (C), and (E) are not the most correct answers.  Each is recognized as being a “submission” within the scope of 37 C.F.R. § 1.114(c). 
11081	(A)the  invention  may  be  properly  represented  in  a  single  application  by  both  an  ink  drawing and a black and white photograph.	1019	f	11.   ANSWER:   (E)   is   correct.      The   statement   finds   support   in   MPEP   §   1503.02,   V.   “Photographs  and  Color  Drawings.”    (A)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.152  states,  “Photographs  and  ink  drawings  are  not  permitted  to  be  combined  as  formal  drawings  in  one application.”    Reproduced  in  MPEP  §  1503.02.

ANSWER:   (E)   is   correct.      The   statement   finds   support   in   MPEP   §   1503.02,   V.   “Photographs  and  Color  Drawings.”    (A)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.152  states,  “Photographs  and  ink  drawings  are  not  permitted  to  be  combined  as  formal  drawings  in  one application.”    Reproduced  in  MPEP  §  1503.02.    (B)  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  § 1.152 states, “Photographs submitted in lieu of ink drawings in design patent applications must not  disclose  environmental  structure  but  must  be  limited  to  the  design  claimed  for  the  article.”    Reproduced in MPEP § 1503.02. 
11084	(D)the  invention  may  be  properly  represented  by  a  color  photograph  disclosing  environmental structure by broken lines, in lieu of an ink drawing if the invention is not capable of being illustrated in an ink drawing. 	1019	f	11.   ANSWER:   (E)   is   correct.      The   statement   finds   support   in   MPEP   §   1503.02,   V.   “Photographs  and  Color  Drawings.”    (A)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.152  states,  “Photographs  and  ink  drawings  are  not  permitted  to  be  combined  as  formal  drawings  in  one application.”    Reproduced  in  MPEP  §  1503.02.

ANSWER:   (E)   is   correct.      The   statement   finds   support   in   MPEP   §   1503.02,   V.   “Photographs  and  Color  Drawings.”    (A)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.152  states,  “Photographs  and  ink  drawings  are  not  permitted  to  be  combined  as  formal  drawings  in  one application.”    Reproduced  in  MPEP  §  1503.02.    (B)  and  (D)  are  wrong  because  37  C.F.R.  § 1.152 states, “Photographs submitted in lieu of ink drawings in design patent applications must not  disclose  environmental  structure  but  must  be  limited  to  the  design  claimed  for  the  article.”    Reproduced in MPEP § 1503.02. 
11086	(A)File,  on  or  before  July  9,  2004,  a  reissue  application,  made  by  MegaCorp  only,  that seeks to add Inventor B.  	1020	f	12.   ANSWER:  The  best  choice  is  (E).  See  MPEP  §  1412.04.    Reissue  is  a  proper  vehicle  for  correcting  inventorship  in  a  patent.    Because  correction  of  inventorship  does  not  enlarge  the  scope  of  the  patent  claims,  the  reissue  application  may  be  filed  more  than  two  years  after  the  patent  issued.    Answers  (A)  and  (B)  are  therefore  both  correct,  and  (E)  is  the  best  response.    Although a certificate of correction may be used to correct inventorship where all parties are in agreement, the facts of the question show that Inventor A is not in agreement.  Choice (C) is thus not  an  available  option  for  MegaCorp.    Choice  (D)  is  incorrect  because  the  provisions  of  37  C.F.R. § 1.48 are not available to correct inventorship in an issued patent. 
11087	(B) File, after July 9, 2004, a reissue application, made by MegaCorp only, that seeksto add Inventor B.	1020	f	12.   ANSWER:  The  best  choice  is  (E).  See  MPEP  §  1412.04.    Reissue  is  a  proper  vehicle  for  correcting  inventorship  in  a  patent.    Because  correction  of  inventorship  does  not  enlarge  the  scope  of  the  patent  claims,  the  reissue  application  may  be  filed  more  than  two  years  after  the  patent  issued.    Answers  (A)  and  (B)  are  therefore  both  correct,  and  (E)  is  the  best  response.    Although a certificate of correction may be used to correct inventorship where all parties are in agreement, the facts of the question show that Inventor A is not in agreement.  Choice (C) is thus not  an  available  option  for  MegaCorp.    Choice  (D)  is  incorrect  because  the  provisions  of  37  C.F.R. § 1.48 are not available to correct inventorship in an issued patent. 
11088	(C) Request a Certificate of Correction to add Inventor B as a named inventor. 	1020	f	12.   ANSWER:  The  best  choice  is  (E).  See  MPEP  §  1412.04.    Reissue  is  a  proper  vehicle  for  correcting  inventorship  in  a  patent.    Because  correction  of  inventorship  does  not  enlarge  the  scope  of  the  patent  claims,  the  reissue  application  may  be  filed  more  than  two  years  after  the  patent  issued.    Answers  (A)  and  (B)  are  therefore  both  correct,  and  (E)  is  the  best  response.    Although a certificate of correction may be used to correct inventorship where all parties are in agreement, the facts of the question show that Inventor A is not in agreement.  Choice (C) is thus not  an  available  option  for  MegaCorp.

11089	(D)  Submit  in  the  issued  patent  file:  a  Request  for  Correction  of  Inventorship  Under  the  Provisions  of  37  CFR  1.48  that  sets  forth  the  desired  inventorship  change;  astatement by Inventor B that the error in inventorship occurred without deceptiveintention on her part; an oath or declaration executed by Inventor B; all requiredfees; and the written consent of MegaCorp. 	1020	f	12.   ANSWER:  The  best  choice  is  (E).  See  MPEP  §  1412.04.    Reissue  is  a  proper  vehicle  for  correcting  inventorship  in  a  patent.    Because  correction  of  inventorship  does  not  enlarge  the  scope  of  the  patent  claims,  the  reissue  application  may  be  filed  more  than  two  years  after  the  patent  issued.    Answers  (A)  and  (B)  are  therefore  both  correct,  and  (E)  is  the  best  response.    Although a certificate of correction may be used to correct inventorship where all parties are in agreement, the facts of the question show that Inventor A is not in agreement.  Choice (C) is thus not  an  available  option  for  MegaCorp.    Choice  (D)  is  incorrect  because  the  provisions  of  37  C.F.R. § 1.48 are not available to correct inventorship in an issued patent.

11096	(A)  The  prior  art  is  a  U.S.  patent  issued  five  years  before  the  effective  date  of  your  client’s application.  The claims are properly rejected under 35 USC 102(b) of the disclosure  in  the  patent  that  anticipates  the  claimed  invention.    Evidence  ofsecondary  considerations,  such  as  unexpected  results  or  commercial  success,  is  relevant to the rejection and thus can overcome the rejection. 	1022	f	14.

11097	(B)  The  prior  art  is  a  U.S.  patent  issued  five  years  before  the  effective  date  of  your  client’s application.  The claims are properly rejected under 35 USC 102(b) overthe  disclosure  in  the  patent  that  anticipates  the  claimed  invention.    The  rejectioncan   be   overcome   by   arguing   that   the   alleged   anticipatory   prior   art   is   “nonanalogous art.”	1022	f	14.   ANSWER:  The  most  correct  answer  is  (E).    (A),  (B),  (C)  and  (D)  are  not  in  accordance  with proper USPTO practice and procedure.  (A) alone is not correct.

11111	(A)In the context of 35 USC 102(b), a magazine need only be placed in the mail to be effective as a printed publication.	1025	f	17.  ANSWER:  (C) is correct.  MPEP § 707.05(f) states, “In the use of [declassified material] ... as an anticipatory publication, the date of release following declassification is the effective date of  publication  within  the  meaning  of  the  statute.”    (A)  is  wrong.    MPEP  §  706.02(a)  states,  “A  magazine is effective as a printed publication under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as of the date it reached the  addressee  and  not  the  date  it  was  placed  in  the  mail.”    (B)  is  wrong.    MPEP  §  707.05(f)  states,  “For  the  purpose  of  anticipation  predicated  upon  prior  knowledge  under  35  U.S.C.  §102(a) the above noted declassified material may be taken as prima facie evidence of such prior knowledge as of its printing date even though such material was classified at that time.”  (D) and (E)  are  wrong.    The  AIPA  amended  35  U.S.C.  §  102(e)  to  provide  that  U.S.  patents,  U.S.  application  publications,  and  certain  international  application  publications  can  be  used  as  prior  art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(e) based on their earliest effective filing date against applications filed on  or  after  November  29,  2000,  and  applications  filed  prior  to  November  29,  2000  which  have  been voluntarily published.  MPEP § 706.02(a). 
11158	(C)      If  the  patent  is  in  the  nature  of  an  improvement  in  an  old  apparatus,  process,product, or composition, the abstract should include the technical disclosure of the improvement.	1034	f	26.   ANSWER:   (E).   The  abstract  should  not  compare  the  invention  with  the  prior  art.    MPEP  §  608.01(b).    As  to  (A)  through  (C),  see  MPEP  §  608.01(b).    As  to  (D),  when  the  process  for  making is not obvious, the process should be set forth in the abstract.  See MPEP § 608.01(b). 
11112	(B)  The  earliest  date  declassified  printed  material  may  be  taken  as  prima  facieevidence of prior knowledge under 35 USC 102(a) is as of the date the material is cataloged and placed on the shelf of a public library.	1025	f	17.  ANSWER:  (C) is correct.  MPEP § 707.05(f) states, “In the use of [declassified material] ... as an anticipatory publication, the date of release following declassification is the effective date of  publication  within  the  meaning  of  the  statute.”    (A)  is  wrong.    MPEP  §  706.02(a)  states,  “A  magazine is effective as a printed publication under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) as of the date it reached the  addressee  and  not  the  date  it  was  placed  in  the  mail.”    (B)  is  wrong.

11186	(A)There  is  no  anticipation  unless  each  of  the  process  steps  recited  in  the  claim  is  disclosed or inherent in the applied reference. 	1040	t	32.  ANSWER:  (A) is the most correct answer.  The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined based on the product itself, not on the process of making it.  SeeIn re Thorpe, 777 F.2d  695,  697,  227  USPQ  964,  966  (Fed.  Cir.  1985),  and  MPEP  §  2113.    (B)  and  (D)  are  not  proper choices because when evidence indicates that the applicant’s product and that of the prior art  are  identical  or  substantially  identical,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  applicant  to  overcome  the  rejection  by  providing  evidence  that  the  prior  art  product  does  not  necessarily  or  inherently  possess a relied-upon characteristic of the applicant’s claimed product.  See In re Fitzgerald, 619 F.2d 67, 70, 205 USPQ 594, 596 (CCPA 1980); In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433-34  (CCPA  1977),  and  MPEP  §  2112.    (C)  is  not  the  proper  choice  because  evidence  of  unexpected results is not relevant to anticipation.  See In re Malagari, 499 F.2d 1297, 1302, 182 USPQ  549,  553  (CCPA  1974),  and  MPEP  §  711.03(c).    (E)  is  not  the  proper  choice  because  a  rejection under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) is a statutory bar to patentability, and 37 C.F.R. § 1.131(a)(2) states  that  §  131  cannot  be  used  to  establish  prior  invention  when  the  rejection  is  based  upon  a  statutory bar.
11187	(B) If the applied reference reasonably indicates that a product disclosed therein is the same  or  substantially  the  same  as  the  claimed  product,  the  burden  shifts  to  theapplicant to provide evidence to the contrary.	1040	f	32.  ANSWER:  (A) is the most correct answer.  The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined based on the product itself, not on the process of making it.

11193	(C) If the Examiner’s Amendment is made exactly 4 months after Xavier’s reply, theapplication will be allowed. 	1041	t	33.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  correct  and  (B)  is  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(f),  part  (H),  states,  “Where a complete first reply to a final Office action has been filed within 2 months of the final Office action, an examiner’s amendment to place the application in condition for allowance may be made without the payment of extension fees even if the examiner’s amendment is made more than  3  months  from  the  date  of  the  final  Office  action.”    (A),  (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP § 706.07(f), part (H), states, “Note that an examiner’s amendment may not be made more than 6 months from the date of the final Office action, as the application would be abandoned at that  point  by  operation  of  law.”    In  (A),  when  an  examiner’s  amendment  is  mailed  exactly  5  months  after  Xavier’s  reply,  the  examiner’s  amendment  would  be  made  more  than  6  months  after the Office action. \\
11194	(D)  The  Examiner’s  Amendment  may  be  made  at  any  time  within  6  months  ofXavier’s reply to avoid abandonment.	1041	f	33.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  correct  and  (B)  is  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(f),  part  (H),  states,  “Where a complete first reply to a final Office action has been filed within 2 months of the final Office action, an examiner’s amendment to place the application in condition for allowance may be made without the payment of extension fees even if the examiner’s amendment is made more than  3  months  from  the  date  of  the  final  Office  action.”    (A),  (D)  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP § 706.07(f), part (H), states, “Note that an examiner’s amendment may not be made more than 6 months from the date of the final Office action, as the application would be abandoned at that  point  by  operation  of  law.”    In  (A),  when  an  examiner’s  amendment  is  mailed  exactly  5  months  after  Xavier’s  reply,  the  examiner’s  amendment  would  be  made  more  than  6  months  after the Office action. \\

11211	(A) The abstract of the disclosure has been interpreted to be a part of the specification for the purpose of compliance with paragraph 1 of 35 USC 112. 	1045	f	37.  ANSWER:  (C).   As  indicated  in  MPEP  §  608.01(b),  if  an  application  is  otherwise  in  condition  for  allowance  except  that  the  abstract  does  not  comply  with  the  guidelines,  the  examiner  generally  should  make  any  necessary  revisions  by  examiner’s  amendment  rather  than  issuing  an  Ex  parte  Quayle  action  requiring  applicant  to  make  the  necessary  revisions.    As  to  (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(b).
11212	(B)  Any  submission  of  a  new  abstract  of  the  disclosure  or  amendment  to  an  existing  abstract should be carefully reviewed for introduction of new matter.	1045	f	37.  ANSWER:  (C).   As  indicated  in  MPEP  §  608.01(b),  if  an  application  is  otherwise  in  condition  for  allowance  except  that  the  abstract  does  not  comply  with  the  guidelines,  the  examiner  generally  should  make  any  necessary  revisions  by  examiner’s  amendment  rather  than  issuing  an  Ex  parte  Quayle  action  requiring  applicant  to  make  the  necessary  revisions.    As  to  (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(b).
11213	(C) If an application is otherwise in condition for allowance except that the abstract ofthe disclosure does not comply with the guidelines, the examiner generally cannotmake any necessary revisions by examiner’s amendment, but should instead issue an Ex parte Quayle action requiring applicant to make the necessary revisions. 	1045	t	37.  ANSWER:  (C).   As  indicated  in  MPEP  §  608.01(b),  if  an  application  is  otherwise  in  condition  for  allowance  except  that  the  abstract  does  not  comply  with  the  guidelines,  the  examiner  generally  should  make  any  necessary  revisions  by  examiner’s  amendment  rather  than  issuing  an  Ex  parte  Quayle  action  requiring  applicant  to  make  the  necessary  revisions.    As  to  (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(b).
11214	(D)Under current practice, in all instances where the application contains an abstractof the disclosure when sent to issue, the abstract will be printed on the patent.	1045	f	37.  ANSWER:  (C).   As  indicated  in  MPEP  §  608.01(b),  if  an  application  is  otherwise  in  condition  for  allowance  except  that  the  abstract  does  not  comply  with  the  guidelines,  the  examiner  generally  should  make  any  necessary  revisions  by  examiner’s  amendment  rather  than  issuing  an  Ex  parte  Quayle  action  requiring  applicant  to  make  the  necessary  revisions.    As  to  (A), (B), (D), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(b).
11582	(D)One of the conditions for benefit under 35 USC 119(a) is that the foreign application must be for the same or a nonobvious improvement of the invention described in the United States application.	1119	t	see MPEP 213
11215	(E)The  content  of  a  patent  abstract  should  be  such  as  to  enable  the  reader  thereof,regardless  of  his  or  her  degree  of  familiarity  with  patent  documents,  to  ascertain  quickly the character of the subject matter covered by the technical disclosure and should include that which is new in the art to which the invention pertains.	1045	f	37.  ANSWER:  (C).   As  indicated  in  MPEP  §  608.01(b),  if  an  application  is  otherwise  in  condition  for  allowance  except  that  the  abstract  does  not  comply  with  the  guidelines,  the  examiner  generally  should  make  any  necessary  revisions  by  examiner’s  amendment  rather  than  issuing  an  Ex  parte  Quayle  action  requiring  applicant  to  make  the  necessary  revisions.

ANSWER:  (D) is the most correct answer.  A reference is a “printed publication” if one of ordinary skill in the art can locate it with reasonable diligence.  Its availability as prior art under §  102(b)  depends  upon  proof  of  when  the  reference  was  “published”  or  became  publicly  accessible.    Here,  (D)  is  the  correct  answer  because  the  Japanese  patent  application  was  published, i.e.,  “laid  open,”  more  than  1  year  before  applicant’s  filing  date.    (C)  is  incorrect  because  it  was  posted  or  published  less  than  one  year  after  applicant’s  filing  date.    (B)  is  incorrect  because  (1)  the  database  retrieval  date  is  after  applicant’s  filing  date,  (2)  the  printout  does not include the date on which the MEDLINE abstract was publicly posted and (3) reliance is on the printout per se not the actual article (reliance on the actual article would require getting the  article  and  an  English  translation  as  well  as  determining  the  date  when  the  journal  was  publicly available).  (A) is incorrect because there is no evidence when the journal was publicly available.  The examiner was unable to determine the actual date of publication.(E) is incorrect because (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect

(C)  is  incorrect  because  it  was  posted  or  published  less  than  one  year  after  applicant’s  filing  date.    (B)  is  incorrect  because  (1)  the  database  retrieval  date  is  after  applicant’s  filing  date,  (2)  the  printout  does not include the date on which the MEDLINE abstract was publicly posted and (3) reliance is on the printout per se not the actual article (reliance on the actual article would require getting the  article  and  an  English  translation  as  well  as  determining  the  date  when  the  journal  was  publicly available).  (A) is incorrect because there is no evidence when the journal was publicly available.  The examiner was unable to determine the actual date of publication.(E) is incorrect because (A), (B) and (C) are incorrect
11221	(A)  A  continuation-in-part  is  an  application  filed  during  the  lifetime  of  an  earlier  nonprovisional  application  by  the  same  applicant,  which  repeat  either  some  substantial portion or all of the earlier nonprovisional application, and adds matternot disclosed in the said earlier nonprovisional application. 	1047	f	39.   ANSWER:  (E).   As  to  (E),  it  is  not  in  accord  with  MPEP  §  201.08  since  the  application  need  not  be  filed  before  a  notice  of  allowance,  but  instead  before  patenting  of  the  first  application.    (A)  through  (C)  are  found  in  MPEP  §  201.08.    As  to  (D),  calling  the  patent  application  a  continuation-in-part  will  result  in  the  application  having  its  patent  term  calculated  from  its  filing  date.    An  application  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  120,  121,  or  365(c)  will  have  its  patent  term  calculated  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  application  was  filed,  provided  a  specific reference is made to the earlier filed application(s).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
11222	(B) A continuation-in-part application may only be filed under 37 CFR 1.53(b).	1047	f	39.   ANSWER:  (E).   As  to  (E),  it  is  not  in  accord  with  MPEP  §  201.08  since  the  application  need  not  be  filed  before  a  notice  of  allowance,  but  instead  before  patenting  of  the  first  application.    (A)  through  (C)  are  found  in  MPEP  §  201.08.    As  to  (D),  calling  the  patent  application  a  continuation-in-part  will  result  in  the  application  having  its  patent  term  calculated  from  its  filing  date.    An  application  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  120,  121,  or  365(c)  will  have  its  patent  term  calculated  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  application  was  filed,  provided  a  specific reference is made to the earlier filed application(s).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
11223	(C)  A  continuation-in-part  application  cannot  be  filed  as  a  continued  prosecution  application (CPA) under 37 CFR 1.53(d). 	1047	f	39.   ANSWER:  (E).   As  to  (E),  it  is  not  in  accord  with  MPEP  §  201.08  since  the  application  need  not  be  filed  before  a  notice  of  allowance,  but  instead  before  patenting  of  the  first  application.    (A)  through  (C)  are  found  in  MPEP  §  201.08.    As  to  (D),  calling  the  patent  application  a  continuation-in-part  will  result  in  the  application  having  its  patent  term  calculated  from  its  filing  date.    An  application  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  120,  121,  or  365(c)  will  have  its  patent  term  calculated  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  application  was  filed,  provided  a  specific reference is made to the earlier filed application(s).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
11224	(D)  An  application  claiming  the  benefits  of  a  provisional  application  under  35  USC  119(e) should not be called a “continuation-in-part” of the provisional application.  	1047	f	39.   ANSWER:  (E).   As  to  (E),  it  is  not  in  accord  with  MPEP  §  201.08  since  the  application  need  not  be  filed  before  a  notice  of  allowance,  but  instead  before  patenting  of  the  first  application.    (A)  through  (C)  are  found  in  MPEP  §  201.08.    As  to  (D),  calling  the  patent  application  a  continuation-in-part  will  result  in  the  application  having  its  patent  term  calculated  from  its  filing  date.    An  application  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  120,  121,  or  365(c)  will  have  its  patent  term  calculated  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  application  was  filed,  provided  a  specific reference is made to the earlier filed application(s).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
11225	(E)One  of  the  formal  requirements  of  35  USC  120  is  that  a  continuation-in-part  application must be “filed before a notice of allowance or abandonment is mailed in the prior application.”	1047	t	39.   ANSWER:  (E).   As  to  (E),  it  is  not  in  accord  with  MPEP  §  201.08  since  the  application  need  not  be  filed  before  a  notice  of  allowance,  but  instead  before  patenting  of  the  first  application.    (A)  through  (C)  are  found  in  MPEP  §  201.08.    As  to  (D),  calling  the  patent  application  a  continuation-in-part  will  result  in  the  application  having  its  patent  term  calculated  from  its  filing  date.    An  application  filed  under  35  U.S.C.  §§  120,  121,  or  365(c)  will  have  its  patent  term  calculated  from  the  date  on  which  the  earliest  application  was  filed,  provided  a  specific reference is made to the earlier filed application(s).  35 U.S.C. § 154(a)(2) and (a)(3). 
11226	(A)Product and process claims should be separately grouped. 	1048	f	40.  ANSWER:  (C) is the most correct answer.  The USPTO does not require or recommend a minimum  or  maximum  number  of  dependent  claims.    37  C.F.R.  §  1.75(c).  (A)  is  a  USPTO  recommendation.

MPEP  §  2143.03,  (Indefinite  Limitations  Must  Be  Considered),  and  see  Ex  parte  Ionescu,  222  USPQ 537 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1984).  (C) is not correct because it is proper procedure to be followed  by  an  examiner.    MPEP  §  2143.03,  (Indefinite  Limitations  Must  Be  Considered),  and  see  In  re  Wilson,  165  USPQ  494  (CCPA  1970)  (if  no  reasonably  definite  meaning  can  be  ascribed  to  certain  claim  language,  the  claim  is  indefinite,  not  obvious).    (D)  is  not  correct  because  it  is  proper  procedure  to  be  followed  by  an  examiner.    MPEP  §  2143.03,  (Limitations  Which  Do  Not  Find  Support  In  The  Original  Specification  Must  Be  Considered),  and  see  Ex parte Grasselli, 231 USPQ 393 (Bd. App. 1983), aff’d mem., 738 F.2d 453 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  (E) is incorrect because the examiner may properly take the actions set forth in (B), (C), and (D).
11246	(A)A reply that presents his argument in a more defensible light and adds additional claims.	1052	f	44.   ANSWER:  (D).   37  C.F.R.  §  1.116;  MPEP  §  714.13,  Entry  Not  Matter  of  Right  [p.  700-118].    The  reply  in  (D)  is  directed  to  a  reply  permitted  to  be  made  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.116(a).    (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  directed  to  the  merits  of  the  application,  and  are  not  in  accord  with  37  C.F.R. § 1.116(a).
11247	(B) A reply amending the claims into process claims.	1052	f	44.   ANSWER:  (D).   37  C.F.R.  §  1.116;  MPEP  §  714.13,  Entry  Not  Matter  of  Right  [p.  700-118].    The  reply  in  (D)  is  directed  to  a  reply  permitted  to  be  made  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.116(a).    (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  directed  to  the  merits  of  the  application,  and  are  not  in  accord  with  37  C.F.R. § 1.116(a).
11251	(A)The Office should treat John as having no ownership rights in the combination. 	1053	f	45.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  a  false  statement  and  therefore  the  correct  answer.    Under  35  U.S.C.  § 261, “An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark  Office  within  three  months  from  its  date  or  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subsequent  purchase or mortgage.” (C) is correct because ABC Corporation acquired all of John’s ownership rights  in  the  original  patent  application,  including  the  subcombination  claimed  in  the  original  nonprovisional  and  divisional  patent  applications.  The  assignment  of  the  rights  to  ABC  Corporation   was   recorded   in   the   USPTO   prior   to   the   subsequent   acquisition   of   the   subcombination  by  XYZ  Corporation.    U.S.C.  §  261.    ABC  Corporation’s  recordation  of  its  assignment gave constructive notice to XYZ Corporation.  MPEP § 306 recites that in the case of a division...application, a prior assignment recorded against the original application is applied to the division...application because the assignment recorded against the original application gives the  assignee  rights  to  the  subject  matter  common  to  both  applications.    (A)  and  (B)  are  true  statements  and  therefore  wrong  answers.    John  gave  up  his  ownership  rights  when  he  executed  the  assignment  to  ABC  Corporation.    The  assignment  to  ABC  Corporation  carries  with  it  the  transfer  of  the  bundle  of  rights  associated  with  subject  matter  common  to  the  original  patent application, e.g., the divisional patent application.  (D) and (E) are true statements and therefore wrong answers because XYZ Corporation acquired no rights in the original or divisional patent applications. MPEP § 306.
11252	(B)   The   Office   should   treat   John   as   having   no   ownership   rights   in   the   subcombination.	1053	f	45.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  a  false  statement  and  therefore  the  correct  answer.    Under  35  U.S.C.  § 261, “An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark  Office  within  three  months  from  its  date  or  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subsequent  purchase or mortgage.” (C) is correct because ABC Corporation acquired all of John’s ownership rights  in  the  original  patent  application,  including  the  subcombination  claimed  in  the  original  nonprovisional  and  divisional  patent  applications.  The  assignment  of  the  rights  to  ABC  Corporation   was   recorded   in   the   USPTO   prior   to   the   subsequent   acquisition   of   the   subcombination  by  XYZ  Corporation.

The  assignment  to  ABC  Corporation  carries  with  it  the  transfer  of  the  bundle  of  rights  associated  with  subject  matter  common  to  the  original  patent application, e.g., the divisional patent application.  (D) and (E) are true statements and therefore wrong answers because XYZ Corporation acquired no rights in the original or divisional patent applications. MPEP § 306.
11253	(C) ABC Corporation has no ownership rights in the subcombination. 	1053	t	45.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  a  false  statement  and  therefore  the  correct  answer.    Under  35  U.S.C.  § 261, “An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark  Office  within  three  months  from  its  date  or  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subsequent  purchase or mortgage.” (C) is correct because ABC Corporation acquired all of John’s ownership rights  in  the  original  patent  application,  including  the  subcombination  claimed  in  the  original  nonprovisional  and  divisional  patent  applications.  The  assignment  of  the  rights  to  ABC  Corporation   was   recorded   in   the   USPTO   prior   to   the   subsequent   acquisition   of   the   subcombination  by  XYZ  Corporation.

(D) and (E) are true statements and therefore wrong answers because XYZ Corporation acquired no rights in the original or divisional patent applications. MPEP § 306.
11254	(D)XYZ Corporation has no ownership rights in the combination.	1053	f	45.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  a  false  statement  and  therefore  the  correct  answer.    Under  35  U.S.C.  § 261, “An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark  Office  within  three  months  from  its  date  or  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subsequent  purchase or mortgage.” (C) is correct because ABC Corporation acquired all of John’s ownership rights  in  the  original  patent  application,  including  the  subcombination  claimed  in  the  original  nonprovisional  and  divisional  patent  applications.  The  assignment  of  the  rights  to  ABC  Corporation   was   recorded   in   the   USPTO   prior   to   the   subsequent   acquisition   of   the   subcombination  by  XYZ  Corporation.

(D) and (E) are true statements and therefore wrong answers because XYZ Corporation acquired no rights in the original or divisional patent applications. MPEP § 306.
11255	(E)XYZ Corporation has no ownership rights in the subcombination.	1053	f	45.   ANSWER:  (C)  is  a  false  statement  and  therefore  the  correct  answer.    Under  35  U.S.C.  § 261, “An assignment, grant, or conveyance shall be void as against any subsequent purchaser or mortgagee for a valuable consideration, without notice, unless it is recorded in the Patent and Trademark  Office  within  three  months  from  its  date  or  prior  to  the  date  of  such  subsequent  purchase or mortgage.” (C) is correct because ABC Corporation acquired all of John’s ownership rights  in  the  original  patent  application,  including  the  subcombination  claimed  in  the  original  nonprovisional  and  divisional  patent  applications.  The  assignment  of  the  rights  to  ABC  Corporation   was   recorded   in   the   USPTO   prior   to   the   subsequent   acquisition   of   the   subcombination  by  XYZ  Corporation.

(D) and (E) are true statements and therefore wrong answers because XYZ Corporation acquired no rights in the original or divisional patent applications. MPEP § 306.
11256	(A)A submission of patents by a member of the public must be made within 2 monthsof the date of publication of the application. 	1054	f	46.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §1.99(e).    (D)  is  correct  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.99(e)  provides,  “A  submission  under  this  section  must  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  application  (§  1.215(a))  or  prior  to  the  mailing  of  a  notice  of  allowance  (§ 1.311), whichever is earlier.”  Therefore, answer (D) is correct and answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.  (E) is wrong because 37 C.F.R. § 1.99(e) recites, “A submission by a member of the public to a pending published application that does not comply with the requirements of this section will be returned or discarded.”
11257	(B)  A  submission  of  patents  by  a  member  of  the  public  must  be  made  prior  to  themailing of a Notice of Allowance.	1054	f	46.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §1.99(e).    (D)  is  correct  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.99(e)  provides,  “A  submission  under  this  section  must  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  application  (§  1.215(a))  or  prior  to  the  mailing  of  a  notice  of  allowance  (§ 1.311), whichever is earlier.”  Therefore, answer (D) is correct and answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.  (E) is wrong because 37 C.F.R. § 1.99(e) recites, “A submission by a member of the public to a pending published application that does not comply with the requirements of this section will be returned or discarded.”
11258	(C) A submission of patents by a member of the public must be made within 2 monthsof the date of publication of the application or prior to the mailing of a Notice of Allowance, whichever is later. 	1054	f	46.

(E) is wrong because 37 C.F.R. § 1.99(e) recites, “A submission by a member of the public to a pending published application that does not comply with the requirements of this section will be returned or discarded.”
11259	(D)A submission of patents by a member of the public must be made within 2 monthsof the date of publication of the application or prior to the mailing of a Notice of Allowance, whichever is earlier.	1054	t	46.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §1.99(e).    (D)  is  correct  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.99(e)  provides,  “A  submission  under  this  section  must  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  application  (§  1.215(a))  or  prior  to  the  mailing  of  a  notice  of  allowance  (§ 1.311), whichever is earlier.”  Therefore, answer (D) is correct and answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.  (E) is wrong because 37 C.F.R. § 1.99(e) recites, “A submission by a member of the public to a pending published application that does not comply with the requirements of this section will be returned or discarded.”
11260	(E)  Any  submission  not  filed  within  the  period  set  forth  in  the  patent  rules  will  beaccepted  provided  it  is  accompanied  by  the  processing  fee  set  forth  in  37  CFR  1.17(i).	1054	f	46.   ANSWER:   (D)  is  correct.    37  C.F.R.  §1.99(e).    (D)  is  correct  because  37  C.F.R.  §  1.99(e)  provides,  “A  submission  under  this  section  must  be  filed  within  two  months  from  the  date  of  publication  of  the  application  (§  1.215(a))  or  prior  to  the  mailing  of  a  notice  of  allowance  (§ 1.311), whichever is earlier.”  Therefore, answer (D) is correct and answers (A), (B), and (C) are incorrect.  (E) is wrong because 37 C.F.R. § 1.99(e) recites, “A submission by a member of the public to a pending published application that does not comply with the requirements of this section will be returned or discarded.”

11274	(D)Facsimile  transmission  of  a  correspondence  to  be  filed  in  a  patent  applicationsubject to a secrecy order under 37 CFR 5.1 through 5.5 and directly related to thesecrecy order content of the application. 	1057	f	49.   ANSWER:  Choice  (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  502.01,  and  37  C.F.R.  §  1.6(d)(3).  MPEP § 502.01 reads, “The date of receipt accorded to any correspondence permitted to be sent by  facsimile  transmission,  including  a  continued  prosecution  application  (CPA)  filed  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.53(d),  is  the  date  the  complete  transmission  is  received  by  an  Office  facsimile  unit...An  applicant  filing  a  CPA  by  facsimile  transmission  must  include  an  authorization  to  charge  the  basic  filing  fee  to  a  deposit  account  or  to  a  credit  card.”  Choice  (A)  is  incorrect  because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) states, “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted and, if submitted, will  not  be  accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(5)  A  request  for  reexamination under §1.510 or § 1.913.” Choice (B) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) also states, “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted and, if submitted, will not be accorded a date of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(4)  Drawings  submitted  under  §§  1.81,  1.83  through  1.85, 1.152, 1.165, 1.174, 1.437, 2.51, 2.52, or 2.72.” Choice (C) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. §  1.6(d)  also  states,    “Facsimile  transmissions  are  not  permitted  and,  if  submitted,  will  not  be accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(3)  Correspondence  which  cannot  receive the benefit of the certificate of mailing or transmission as specified in 1.8(a)(2)(i)(A)...” 37  C.F.R.  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(A)  reads,  “The  filing  of  a  national  patent  application  specification  and  drawing  or  other  correspondence  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  an  application  filing  date...”  Choice (D) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) also states,  “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted  and,  if  submitted,  will  not  be  accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(6) Correspondence to be filed in a patent application subject to a secrecy order under §§ 5.1 through 5.5 of this chapter and directly related to the secrecy order content of the application.”
11636	(C) The examiner’s rejection of the claims to the compound under 35 USC 103, stating that it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to test the by product of a newly-discovered microorganism for therapeutic uses.	1130	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131. MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).” Here, the claimed microorganism and the prior art microorganism appear to be the identical. (A) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2105, under the heading “Patentable Subject Matter – Living Subject Matter,” states “...the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability.” The Supreme Court has held that biological materials such as microorganisms, and non-human animals, is patentable subject matter, provided it is made by man. Here, Eric’s isolation and purification the microorganism from its natural state (environment) makes it a product of human ingenuity, as opposed to a product of nature. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980). (B) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “III. Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” states that the “courts have found utility for therapeutic invention despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or bioactive compound or composition.” See, Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also, In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Citing Brana, MPEP § 2107.01 states, “Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe 35 USC 101, under the logic of ‘practical’ utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans.” See also, MPEP § 2107.03, under the heading “Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utilities, I. A Reasonable Correlation Between the Evidence and the Asserted Utility is Sufficient,” which states “As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility. Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Jolles, 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 206 F.2d 881 (CCPA 1981). An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use.” Since mice are routinely used to test anti-cancer drugs for their tumoricidal activity, it is reasonable to assume that the compound, spectaculysem, may be useful as a therapeutic agent. (C) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2145, under the subheading “X. Arguing Improper Rationales for Combining References. A. Impermissible Hindsight.” If, as acknowledged by the examiner, a novel microorganism has been discovered, then any product which it makes could not have been anticipated by, or obvious over, the prior art. The examiner’s rejection is based purely on hindsight derived from his or her reading of the applicant’s specification.
11275	(E)Facsimile  transmission  of  a  continued  prosecution  application  under  37  CFR  1.53(d) and an authorization to charge the basic filing fee to a deposit account. 	1057	t	49.   ANSWER:  Choice  (E)  is  the  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  502.01,  and  37  C.F.R.  §  1.6(d)(3).  MPEP § 502.01 reads, “The date of receipt accorded to any correspondence permitted to be sent by  facsimile  transmission,  including  a  continued  prosecution  application  (CPA)  filed  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.53(d),  is  the  date  the  complete  transmission  is  received  by  an  Office  facsimile  unit...An  applicant  filing  a  CPA  by  facsimile  transmission  must  include  an  authorization  to  charge  the  basic  filing  fee  to  a  deposit  account  or  to  a  credit  card.”  Choice  (A)  is  incorrect  because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) states, “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted and, if submitted, will  not  be  accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(5)  A  request  for  reexamination under §1.510 or § 1.913.” Choice (B) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) also states, “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted and, if submitted, will not be accorded a date of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(4)  Drawings  submitted  under  §§  1.81,  1.83  through  1.85, 1.152, 1.165, 1.174, 1.437, 2.51, 2.52, or 2.72.” Choice (C) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. §  1.6(d)  also  states,    “Facsimile  transmissions  are  not  permitted  and,  if  submitted,  will  not  be accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(3)  Correspondence  which  cannot  receive the benefit of the certificate of mailing or transmission as specified in 1.8(a)(2)(i)(A)...” 37  C.F.R.  §  1.8(a)(2)(i)(A)  reads,  “The  filing  of  a  national  patent  application  specification  and  drawing  or  other  correspondence  for  the  purpose  of  obtaining  an  application  filing  date...”  Choice (D) is incorrect because 37 C.F.R. § 1.6(d) also states,  “Facsimile transmissions are not permitted  and,  if  submitted,  will  not  be  accorded  a  date  of  receipt  in  the  following  situations:  ...(6) Correspondence to be filed in a patent application subject to a secrecy order under §§ 5.1 through 5.5 of this chapter and directly related to the secrecy order content of the application.”
11276	(A)if the applicant indicates in the oath accompanying the reissue application that the claims will be broadened.  	1058	t	50.   ANSWER:  (A)  is  correct.    MPEP  §  1412.03.    In  re  Doll,  164  USPQ  218,  220  (CCPA  1970).  (B) is wrong because 35 U.S.C. § 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues.  (C) is wrong because although Switzer v. Sockman, 142 USPQ 226 (CCPA 1964), holds that while a reissue application filed on the 2-year anniversary date from the patent grant is considered to be filed within 2 years of the patent grant, it is necessary that an intent to broaden be indicated in the reissue application within the two years from the patent grant.  MPEP §  1412.03.    (D)  is  wrong  because  a  proposal  for  broadened  claims  must  be  made  in  the  parent  reissue application within two years from the grant of the original patent  MPEP § 1412.03.  In re Graff, 42 USPQ2d 1471, 1473-74 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  (E) is wrong because there was no intent to broaden indicated within the two years.  MPEP § 1412.03.  In re Fotland, 228 USPQ 193 (Fed.

MPEP  §  1412.03.    In  re  Doll,  164  USPQ  218,  220  (CCPA  1970).  (B) is wrong because 35 U.S.C. § 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues.  (C) is wrong because although Switzer v. Sockman, 142 USPQ 226 (CCPA 1964), holds that while a reissue application filed on the 2-year anniversary date from the patent grant is considered to be filed within 2 years of the patent grant, it is necessary that an intent to broaden be indicated in the reissue application within the two years from the patent grant.  MPEP §  1412.03.    (D)  is  wrong  because  a  proposal  for  broadened  claims  must  be  made  in  the  parent  reissue application within two years from the grant of the original patent  MPEP § 1412.03.

11365	(E)None of the above.  	1075	f	17. ANSWER:  (D) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 608.01(n).  (A) is incorrect because adependent claim must further limit the subject matter of a previous claim.  37 C.F.R. § 1.75(c).The  claim  in  (B)  is  actually  inconsistent  with  claim  1.    (B)  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  antecedent basis for the wheels.  MPEP § 2173.05(e).  (C) is incorrect because it does not refer back in the alternative only.  MPEP § 608.01(n).  (E) is incorrect because (D) is correct.
11281	(A)Where  joint  inventors  are  named,  the  examiner  should  not  inquire  of  the  patent  applicant  concerning  the  inventors  and  the  invention  dates  for  the  subject  matter  of  the  various  claims  until  it  becomes  necessary  to  do  so  in  order  to  properly  examine the application.	1059	f	1. ANSWER:  (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S.applications. As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07 at p. 600-49, right column.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119 which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed ina country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or tocitizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
11282	(B) Under 35 USC 119(a), the foreign priority benefit may be claimed to any foreign application that names a U.S. inventor as long as the U.S. named inventor was theinventor of the foreign application invention and 35 USC 119(a)-(d) requirements are met.	1059	f	1. ANSWER:  (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S.applications. As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07 at p. 600-49, right column.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119 which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed ina country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or tocitizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
11283	(C)   Where   two   or   more   foreign   applications   are   combined   in   a   single   U.S.   application, to take advantage of the changes to 35 USC 103 or 35 USC 116, the U.S.  application  may  claim  benefit  under  35  USC  119(a)  to  each  of  the  foreign  applications provided all the requirements of 35 USC 119(a)-(d) are met.	1059	f	1. ANSWER:  (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S.applications. As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07 at p. 600-49, right column.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119 which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed ina country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or tocitizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
11284	(D)One  of  the  conditions  for  benefit  under  35  USC  119(a)  is  that  the  foreign  application  must  be  for  the  same  or  a  nonobvious  improvement  of  the  inventiondescribed in the United States application. 	1059	t	1. ANSWER:  (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S.applications. As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07 at p. 600-49, right column.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119 which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed ina country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or tocitizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
11285	(E)If a foreign application for which priority is being claimed under 35 USC 119 is filed  in  a  country  which  does  not  afford  similar  privileges  in  the  case  ofapplications  filed  in  the  United  States  or  to  citizens  of  the  United  States  and  theforeign country is not a WTO member country, any claim for the foreign priority thereto by a U.S. application will not be effective.	1059	f	1. ANSWER:  (D) is the best answer as the inventions must be the same in the foreign and U.S.applications. As to (A) through (C), see MPEP § 605.07 at p. 600-49, right column.  As to (E), see 35 U.S.C. § 119 which provides that the previously filed application must have been filed ina country that affords similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or tocitizens of the United States or in a WTO member country. 
11286	(A)In a 37 CFR 1.131 affidavit or declaration, it is sufficient to allege that applicantor patent owner has been diligent. 	1060	f	2.  ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  Ex  parte  Merz,  75  USPQ  296  (Bd.  App.  1947)  (holding  that  the  “lapse  of  time  between  the  completion  or  reduction  to  practice  of  aninvention  and  the  filing  of  an  application  thereon”  is  not  relevant  to  an  affidavit  or  declarationunder 37 C.F.R. § 1.131(b)); MPEP § 715.07(a).  (A) is incorrect.  Ex parte Hunter, 1889 C.D. 218,  49  O.G.  733  (Comm’r  Pat.  1889);  MPEP  §  715.07(a).    Applicant  must  show  evidence  offacts establishing diligence.  (C) is incorrect.

(D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 715.07(c).  37 C.F.R. § 1.131(a) provides for the establishment of a date ofcompletion  of  the  invention  in  a  NAFTA  or  WTO  member  country,  as  well  as  in  the  UnitedStates, an applicant can establish a date of completion in a NAFTA member country on or after December  8,  1993,  the  effective  date  of  section  331  of  Public  Law  103  -  182,  the  North  American Free Trade Agreement Act, and can establish a date of completion in a WTO member country other than a NAFTA member country on or after January 1, 1996, the effective date of section 531 of Public Law 103 - 465, the Uruguay Round Agreements Act.  Not all countries aremembers of NAFTA or WTO, and prior invention in a foreign country cannot be shown without regard  for  when  the  reduction  to  practice  occurred.    (E)  is  incorrect.    MPEP  §  715.07.    Actual  reduction  to  practice  generally,  but  not  always,  requires  a  showing  that  the  apparatus  actually  existed  and  worked,  “There  are  some  devices  so  simple  that  a  mere  construction  of  them  is  all  that is necessary to constitute reduction to practice.”  In re Asahi/America Inc., 68 F.3d 442, 37 USPQ2d  1204  (Fed.

The  claimed  restraint  coupling  held  to  be  so  simple  a  device  that  mere  construction  of  it  was  sufficient to constitute reduction to practice.  Photographs, coupled with articles and a technical report describing the coupling in detail were sufficient to show reduction to practice.). 
11287	(B)  In  a  37  CFR  1.131  affidavit  or  declaration,  it  is  sufficient  to  clearly  establish  conception  of  the  invention  prior  to  the  effective  date  of  the  reference,  and  diligence from just prior to the effective date of the reference to actual reduction to practice.  The presence of a lapse of time between the reduction to practice of an invention and the filing of an application thereon is not relevant.	1060	t	2.  ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    See  Ex  parte  Merz,  75  USPQ  296  (Bd.

As stated by MPEP § 706.01,“The  practical  difference  between  a  rejection  and  an  objection  is  that  a  rejection,  involving  the  merits of the claim, is subject to review by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, whilean objection, if persisted, may be reviewed only by way of petition to the Commissioner.”  (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 706.03(d).  (E) is incorrect.  As stated in MPEP § 706.01, “If the form of theclaim (as distinguished from its substance) is improper, an “objection” is made.  An example of a matter of form as to which objection is made is dependency of a claim on a rejected claim, if the dependent claim is otherwise allowable.  See MPEP § § 608.01(n).” 
11364	(D)3.  An  apparatus  as  in  any  of  the  preceding  claims,  in  which  the  circular  backmember is wooden.	1075	t	17. ANSWER:  (D) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 608.01(n).  (A) is incorrect because adependent claim must further limit the subject matter of a previous claim.  37 C.F.R. § 1.75(c).The  claim  in  (B)  is  actually  inconsistent  with  claim  1.    (B)  is  incorrect  because  there  is  no  antecedent basis for the wheels.  MPEP § 2173.05(e).  (C) is incorrect because it does not refer back in the alternative only.  MPEP § 608.01(n).  (E) is incorrect because (D) is correct.

As to (E), according to MPEP § 605.04(a),it is improper for an applicant to sign an oath or declaration which is not attached to or does notidentify the patent application. 
11344	(D)Non-initialed or non-dated handwritten alterations to the claims on an applicationfiled  in  the  USPTO  are  considered  to  be  a  minor  informality.    Thus,  the  Office  personnel should not object to the same.	1071	f	13.  ANSWER:  (A).   MPEP  605.04(a)  provides  that  non-initialed  or  non-dated  alterations  arenot  in  accord  with  37  C.F.R.  §  1.52(c).

(D)  is  correct  because  MPEP  §  601.01(c)states,  “In  addition,  if  the  provisional  application  was  not  filed  with  an  executed  oath  or  declaration  and  the  filing  fee  for  a  non-provisional  application,  the  surcharge  set  forth  in  37  C.F.R.  §  1.16(e)  is  required.    (E)  is  wrong  because  the  action  taken  claims  priority  under  35  U.S.C. § 119(e)(1) rather than conversion under 37C.F.R. § 1.53(c)(3).  No surcharge is required.
11347	(B)   File   a   request   to   convert   the   provisional   application   to   a   nonprovisionalapplication,   accompanied   by   a   proper   executed   declaration,   an   amendment   including  at  least  one  claim  as  prescribed  by  paragraph  2  of  35  USC  112,  the  proper   fee   set   forth   in   37   CFR   1.17(i),   and   the   basic   filing   fee   for   thenonprovisional application. 	1072	f	14.

11350	(E)File  a  nonprovisional  application  including  at  least  one  claim  accompanied  by  a  proper  executed  declaration  but  without  the  basic  filing  fee.    The  applicationcontains a specific reference to the provisional application in compliance with 37 CFR 1.78(a)(5).	1072	f	14.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    (A),  (B)  and  (C)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  601.01(c)  states,  “Claiming  priority  is  less  expensive  [than  conversion]  and  will  result  in  a  longer  patent  term.” Conversion  requires  payment  of  the  conversion  fee.    (D)  is  correct  because  MPEP  §  601.01(c)states,  “In  addition,  if  the  provisional  application  was  not  filed  with  an  executed  oath  or  declaration  and  the  filing  fee  for  a  non-provisional  application,  the  surcharge  set  forth  in  37  C.F.R.  §  1.16(e)  is  required.    (E)  is  wrong  because  the  action  taken  claims  priority  under  35  U.S.C. § 119(e)(1) rather than conversion under 37C.F.R. § 1.53(c)(3).  No surcharge is required.
11351	(A)      Claim      2.    	1073	t	15.  ANSWER:  (A)  is  accepted  as  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2173.05(e).    Claim  2  isindefinite because it is not clear which “said pipe” the claim is referring to since claim 1 recites acopper  pipe  and  an  aluminum  pipe.    Accordingly,  claim  2  provides  the  basis  for  a  properrejection  under  35  U.S.C.  §  112,  second  paragraph.    In  (B),  claim  3  would  be  construed  as  definite,  inasmuch  as  “the  outer  circumference”  is  an  inherent  part  of  the  pipe  and  would  notrequire  antecedent  recitation.    Thus  claim  3  does  not  provide  a  proper  basis  for  the  rejection.  Therefore, (B) and (D) would be incorrect.  Claim 4 is definite inasmuch as there is antecedentbasis for “said plastic valve.”  Therefore, (C) and (E) are incorrect.
11352	(B)       Claim       3.  	1073	f	15.  ANSWER:  (A)  is  accepted  as  the  most  correct  answer.    MPEP  §  2173.05(e).    Claim  2  isindefinite because it is not clear which “said pipe” the claim is referring to since claim 1 recites acopper  pipe  and  an  aluminum  pipe.    Accordingly,  claim  2  provides  the  basis  for  a  properrejection  under  35  U.S.C.  §  112,  second  paragraph.    In  (B),  claim  3  would  be  construed  as  definite,  inasmuch  as  “the  outer  circumference”  is  an  inherent  part  of  the  pipe  and  would  notrequire  antecedent  recitation.    Thus  claim  3  does  not  provide  a  proper  basis  for  the  rejection.  Therefore, (B) and (D) would be incorrect.  Claim 4 is definite inasmuch as there is antecedentbasis for “said plastic valve.”  Therefore, (C) and (E) are incorrect.

Since choice (E) may be done, 37C.F.R. § 1.111, it also is an incorrect answer to the above question. 
11381	(A)Applicant’s claims have been twice objected to, but have not been rejected. 	1079	f	21.  ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.  MPEP  §  1205,  and  37  C.F.R.  §  1.191(a).  MPEP § 1205 states that “A notice of appeal may be filed after any of the claims has been twice rejected,  regardless  of  whether  the  claim(s)  has/have  been  finally  rejected.  The  limitation  of‘twice or finally...rejected’ does not have to be related to a particular application. For example, if any claim was rejected in a parent application, and the claim is again rejected in a continuingapplication, then applicant will be entitled to file an appeal in the continuing application, even if the  claim  was  rejected  only  once  in  the  continuing  application.”  Choices  (A),  (C),  and  (D)  are  each  incorrect  because  Applicant’s  claims  were  not  twice  or  finally  rejected.  37  C.F.R.  §  1.191(a).  MPEP  §  706.01  in  pertinent  part  provides,  “The  practical  difference  between  a  rejection  and  an  objection  is  that  a  rejection,  involving  the  merits  of  the  claim,  is  subject  toreview by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, while an objection, if persisted, may bereviewed only by way of petition to the Commissioner.” Choice (E) is incorrect because Choices (A), (C), and (D) are incorrect.  
11393	(C)  Design  patent  applications  are  included  in  the  Patent  Cooperation  Treaty  (PCT),  and the procedures followed for PCT international applications are to be followed for design patent applications. 	1081	t	23.  ANSWER:  (C)  is  the  best  choice  because  there  is  no  provision  for  design  patents  under  PCT.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (A)  is  a  true  statement.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (B)  is  a  true  statement.  MPEP § 1502.  (D) is a true statement.  MPEP § 1504.01(a), I.A.  (E) is a true statement.  MPEP§ 1504.01(b). 
11394	(D)A  claim  directed  to  a  computer-generated  icon  shown  on  a  computer  screen  complies with the “article of manufacture” requirement of 35 USC 171. 	1081	f	23.  ANSWER:  (C)  is  the  best  choice  because  there  is  no  provision  for  design  patents  under  PCT.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (A)  is  a  true  statement.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (B)  is  a  true  statement.  MPEP § 1502.  (D) is a true statement.  MPEP § 1504.01(a), I.A.  (E) is a true statement.  MPEP§ 1504.01(b). 
11382	(B)Applicant’s  claims  have  been  rejected  once  in  a  non-final  Office  action  during  examination of a parent application, and once in a non-final Office action during examination of a continuing application.  	1079	t	21.  ANSWER:  Choice  (B)  is  the  correct  answer.  MPEP  §  1205,  and  37  C.F.R.  §  1.191(a).  MPEP § 1205 states that “A notice of appeal may be filed after any of the claims has been twice rejected,  regardless  of  whether  the  claim(s)  has/have  been  finally  rejected.

11386	(A)In  order  to  correct  inventorship  in  a  nonprovisional  application  where  the  statement  of  the  lack  of  deceptive  intent  is  not  available  from  an  inventor  to  beadded, a petition under 37 CFR 1.181 may be properly filed. 	1080	f	22. ANSWERS: (D) and (E) were accepted. As to  (D),  see  MPEP  §  201.03  at  p.  200-4.    The  language  in  answer  (D)  is  literally  found  in  MPEP  §  201.03,  which  states,  “Requests  under  37CFR  1.48  are  generally  decided  by  the  primary  examiner  except  .  .  .  (D)  When  a  secondconversion  under  37  CFR  1.48(a)  is  attempted  (decided  by  the  Technology  Center  (TC)Director).”    Answer  (E)  was  accepted  inasmuch  as  the  word  “conversion”  in  answer  (D)  andMPEP 201.03 at page 200-4 may be confusing.  Although answer (D) references 37 CFR 1.48,which  addresses  correction  of  inventorship,  answer  (D)  uses  “conversion,”  a  word  that  is  nottypically used when addressing correction of inventorship.  To the extent “conversion” in answer (D)  and  MPEP  201.03  at  page  200-4  may  be  inaccurate  terminology  in  the  context  in  which  it  was used, it may have caused some candidates to select answer (E), none of the above.  Answer (E) is dependent on answer (D).  Inasmuch as answer (D) used inaccurate terminology, selection of  answer  (E)  can  be  a  reasonable  alternative.    Accordingly,  answer  (E)  was  accepted  at  this  time.  Answers (A), (B) and (C) are independent of the content of answer (D).  Thus, selection ofthese answers, which are incorrect, was not accepted as a correct answer.  As to (A) the petitionto be filed would be under 37 C.F.R. § 1.183.  As to (B), 35 U.S.C. § 116 provides that inventorsmay  apply  for  a  patent  jointly.    A  person  not  named  in  the  application  could  not  file  a  petitionunder  37  C.F.R.  §  1.48  as  this  would  not  be  a  joint  filing.    In  accordance  with  MPEP  1901.05,unless  a  protestor  has  been  granted  access,  the  protestor  is  not  entitled  to  any  information  including the fact that the application exists.  MPEP at 1900-6.  The patent application process is ex parte, and inventorship may only be contestedinter partes (between opposing parties) in theUSPTO through the interference process.  MPEP § 1901.07 precludes the protestor from further participation beyond submission of the protest. See also 37 C.F.R. § 1.291(c).  (C) is incorrect atleast for the reasons that if the application is involved in an interference the Board will decide thepetition.  See MPEP § 201.03. 
11395	(E)  A  claimed  design  may  encompass  multiple  articles  or  multiple  parts  within  an  article. 	1081	f	23.  ANSWER:  (C)  is  the  best  choice  because  there  is  no  provision  for  design  patents  under  PCT.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (A)  is  a  true  statement.    MPEP  §  1502.01.    (B)  is  a  true  statement.  MPEP § 1502.  (D) is a true statement.  MPEP § 1504.01(a), I.A.  (E) is a true statement.  MPEP§ 1504.01(b). 
11387	(B) If a person A learns that a patent application has been filed by person B withoutnaming  A  as  coinventor,  A  may  file  in  the  USPTO  a  petition  that  protests  inventorship  and  directs  B  to  add  A’s  name  as  a  coinventor  to  the  patentapplication.	1080	f	22.

Answer (E) is dependent on answer (D).  Inasmuch as answer (D) used inaccurate terminology, selection of  answer  (E)  can  be  a  reasonable  alternative.    Accordingly,  answer  (E)  was  accepted  at  this  time.  Answers (A), (B) and (C) are independent of the content of answer (D).  Thus, selection ofthese answers, which are incorrect, was not accepted as a correct answer.  As to (A) the petitionto be filed would be under 37 C.F.R. § 1.183.  As to (B), 35 U.S.C. § 116 provides that inventorsmay  apply  for  a  patent  jointly.    A  person  not  named  in  the  application  could  not  file  a  petitionunder  37  C.F.R.  §  1.48  as  this  would  not  be  a  joint  filing.    In  accordance  with  MPEP  1901.05,unless  a  protestor  has  been  granted  access,  the  protestor  is  not  entitled  to  any  information  including the fact that the application exists.  MPEP at 1900-6.  The patent application process is ex parte, and inventorship may only be contestedinter partes (between opposing parties) in theUSPTO through the interference process.  MPEP § 1901.07 precludes the protestor from further participation beyond submission of the protest. See also 37 C.F.R. § 1.291(c).  (C) is incorrect atleast for the reasons that if the application is involved in an interference the Board will decide thepetition.  See MPEP § 201.03. 
11390	(E)None of the above. 	1080	t	22. ANSWERS: (D) and (E) were accepted. As to  (D),  see  MPEP  §  201.03  at  p.  200-4.    The  language  in  answer  (D)  is  literally  found  in  MPEP  §  201.03,  which  states,  “Requests  under  37CFR  1.48  are  generally  decided  by  the  primary  examiner  except  .  .  .  (D)  When  a  secondconversion  under  37  CFR  1.48(a)  is  attempted  (decided  by  the  Technology  Center  (TC)Director).”    Answer  (E)  was  accepted  inasmuch  as  the  word  “conversion”  in  answer  (D)  andMPEP 201.03 at page 200-4 may be confusing.

11401	(A) A Notice of Allowability. 	1083	f	25.  ANSWER:  The  most  correct  answer  is  (D).    See  MPEP  §  706.07(h),  page  700-71,  under“IV.  IMPROPER CPA TREATED AS RCE.”  The request for a second CPA filed on December28, 2001 is improper because the application in which the CPA was filed in has a filing date of December 29, 2000 and is not eligible for the CPA practice.  The CPA practice does not apply toapplications that have a filing date on or after May 29, 2000.  The Office will automatically treat the  improper  request  for  a  CPA  as  a  Request  for  Continued  Examination  under  37  C.F.R.  §  1.114.    However,  the  request  for  a  CPA  filed  on  December  28,  2001  does  not  satisfy  the  requirements of 37 C.F.R. § 1.114 to be a proper RCE because it lacks the filing fee required by 37 C.F.R. § 1.17, and the required submission under 37 C.F.R. § 1.114.  Therefore, the improperCPA will be treated as an improper RCE and the time period set in the last Office action mailed on June 28, 2001will continue to run.  Since the time period expired on December 28, 2001, theapplication  is  abandoned.    Answers  (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  incorrect  because  the  request  for  a  second  CPA  filed  on  December  28,  2001  is  improper  and  the  amendment  was  not  entered.  Answer  (E)  is  incorrect  because  a  request  for  a  suspension  of  action  will  not  be  granted  if  the  CPA  or  the  RCE  is  improper  (e.g.,  a  filing  date  was  not  accorded  in  the  CPA  or  the  RCE  was  filed without a submission).  See 37 C.F.R. § 1.103, MPEP § 709, page 700-113.
11415	(E)The  claims  to  the  same  invention  in  application  Y  should  be  rejected  under  35  USC 102(e) as being anticipated by application X.	1085	f	27.  ANSWER:  (C)  is  correct    35  U.S.C.  §  102(e);  MPEP  §  804,  Chart  III-A.    (C)  is  correctbecause section I. of MPEP § 706.02(f) states, “If (1)...the applications are commonly assigned and  (2)  the  effective  filing  dates  are  different,  then  a  provisional  rejection  of  the  later  filed  application should be made.”  (A) is wrong because the facts do not indicate prior knowledge or use by others, or that the application Y is patented or published.  (B) is wrong because the facts do not indicate that the application Y is patented or published, or the existence of “public use” or“on  sale”  bars.    (D)  is  wrong.    This  is  a  statutory  double  patenting  situation  that  cannot  be  avoided by filing a terminal disclaimer.  See In re Bartfeld, 17 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1991).MPEP  §  706.02(f),  section  I;  MPEP  §  804.02,  part  I.    (E)  is  wrong.    It  is  improper  to  make  a  nonprovisional  rejection  under  §  102(e)  in  the  circumstances  described  in  the  question.    Choice  (E) provides for an improper nonprovisional rejection under § 102(e).  MPEP § 804, Chart I-A. 
11402	(B) A Notice to File Missing Parts. 	1083	f	25.  ANSWER:  The  most  correct  answer  is  (D).    See  MPEP  §  706.07(h),  page  700-71,  under“IV.

Since the time period expired on December 28, 2001, theapplication  is  abandoned.    Answers  (A),  (B),  and  (C)  are  incorrect  because  the  request  for  a  second  CPA  filed  on  December  28,  2001  is  improper  and  the  amendment  was  not  entered.  Answer  (E)  is  incorrect  because  a  request  for  a  suspension  of  action  will  not  be  granted  if  the  CPA  or  the  RCE  is  improper  (e.g.,  a  filing  date  was  not  accorded  in  the  CPA  or  the  RCE  was  filed without a submission).

11406	(A)Amend Claim 3 to read: “The Ethernet cable as made by the process set forth in claims 1-2.”	1084	f	26.  ANSWER:  (B)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    The  cancellation  of  Claim  3  overcomes  the  examiner’s objection.  The addition of Claims 4 and 5 provide the client with patent protection inproduct  by  process  format  for  the  cable  by  both  methods  of  manufacture.    Thus,  if  Claim  4  is  invalid,  Claim  5  may  remain  valid.    Answer  (A)  is  incorrect  because  it  is  an  improper  multipledependent  claim.    35  U.S.C.  §  112  ¶  5;  37  C.F.R.  §  1.75(c);  MPEP  §  608.01(n),  part  (I)(B)(1).Answer  (C)  alone  is  not  the  most  correct  answer  because  even  though  canceling  Claim  3  will  overcome  the  rejection  and  provides  protection  for  the  Ethernet  cable  made  by  the  process  comprising the steps A, B and C, it will also leave the application without a claim to the Ethernet cable made using the processes comprising the steps of A, B, C, and D.  Answer (D) alone is not the most correct answer because even though canceling Claim 3 will overcome the rejection and provides protection for the Ethernet cable made by the process comprising the steps A, B, C, andD,  it  will  also  leave  the  application  without  a  claim  to  the  Ethernet  cable  made  using  theprocesses  comprising  the  steps  of  A,  B,  and  C.    Answer  (E)  alone  is  incorrect  because,  eventhough canceling the claim will overcome the rejection, it will also leave the application without a claim to the Ethernet cable made using the processes set forth in either Claim 1 or Claim 2.

11441	(A)If  Xavier  gives  authorization  for  the  Examiner’s  Amendment  exactly  2  months  after his reply, the application will be allowed. 	1091	f	33.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    (A),  (C),  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(f),  paragraph  (I),  states,  “Where  a  complete  first  reply  to  a  final  Office  action  has  not  been  filed  within  2  months  of  the  final  Office  action,  applicant’s  authorization  to  make  an  amendment  to  place  the  application  in  condition  for  allowance  must  be  made  either  within  the  3  monthshortened  statutory  period  or  within  an  extended  period  for  reply  that  has  been  petitioned  and  paid  for  by  applicant  pursuant  to  37  C.F.R.  §  1.136(a).”    (B)  is  wrong  because  MPEP  § 706.07(f), paragraph (H), states, “Note that an examiner’s amendment may not be made more than 6 months from the date of the final Office action, as the application would be abandoned atthat point by operation of law.” 
11442	(B) Authorization for the Examiner’s Amendment may be made at any time within 6 months of Xavier’s reply to avoid abandonment of the application.. 	1091	f	33.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.

ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    (A),  (C),  and  (E)  are  wrong  because  MPEP  §  706.07(f),  paragraph  (I),  states,  “Where  a  complete  first  reply  to  a  final  Office  action  has  not  been  filed  within  2  months  of  the  final  Office  action,  applicant’s  authorization  to  make  an  amendment  to  place  the  application  in  condition  for  allowance  must  be  made  either  within  the  3  monthshortened  statutory  period  or  within  an  extended  period  for  reply  that  has  been  petitioned  and  paid  for  by  applicant  pursuant  to  37  C.F.R.  §  1.136(a).”    (B)  is  wrong  because  MPEP  § 706.07(f), paragraph (H), states, “Note that an examiner’s amendment may not be made more than 6 months from the date of the final Office action, as the application would be abandoned atthat point by operation of law.” 
11445	(E)Abandonment of the application will be avoided if Xavier gives authorization for the Examiner’s Amendment any time within 6 months of the mail date of a final Office   action.      No   extension   of   time   need   be   filed   if   Xavier   gives   the   authorization between 3 months and 6 months after the Office action. 	1091	f	33.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.

(B)  and  (C)  are  wrong.    The  reply  was  not  filed  on  May  14,  2002,  because  the  conditions  of  37  C.F.R.  §  1.10(b)  were  not  satisfied.  For example, the number of the “Express Mail” mailing label must have been placed on  each  page  of  the  response  prior  to  the  original  mailing  by  “Express  Mail.”    The  petition  should not be expected to be granted inasmuch as the papers did not include the number of the “Express Mail” mailing label on them.

For example, the number of the “Express Mail” mailing label must have been placed on  each  page  of  the  response  prior  to  the  original  mailing  by  “Express  Mail.”    The  petition  should not be expected to be granted inasmuch as the papers did not include the number of the “Express Mail” mailing label on them. See § 1.10(c)(2), (d)(2), and (e)(2).  (E) is wrong because37 C.F.R. § 1.10(b) requires that “the number of the ‘Express Mail’ mailing label must have beenplaced on each page of the response prior to the original mailing by ‘Express Mail.’”  Emphasis added.

ANSWER:  (D)  is  the  most  correct  answer.    Reference  characteristics  mentioned  in  the  detailed  description  must  appear  in  the  drawings.    37  C.F.R.  §§  1.83(a)  and  1.84(p)(5);  MPEP§ 608.02.  As to (A), (B), (C), and (E), see MPEP § 608.01(a). 
11466	(A)  A  claim  to  a  process  omitting  a  step  in  a  disclosed  process,  where  the  step  isdisclosed in the specification to be essential to the invention, may not be properly rejected  under  35  USC  112,  first  paragraph,  for  lack  of  enablement  where  thespecification provides an enabling disclosure only for the process which includes the essential step.	1096	f	38. ANSWER:  (C) is the most correct answer.  As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails  to  interrelate  essential  elements  of  the  invention  as  defined  by  applicant(s)  in  the  specification  may  be  rejected  under  35  U.S.C.  §  112,  second  paragraph,  for  failure  to  point  outand  distinctly  claim  the  invention.    See  In  re  Venezia,  530  F.2d  956,  189  USPQ  149  (CCPA1976); In re Collier, 397 F.2d 1003, 158 USPQ 266 (CCPA 1968).”  (A) is incorrect.  As statedin  MPEP  §  2172.01,  “A  claim  which  omits  matter  disclosed  to  be  essential  to  the  invention  as  described  in  the  specification  or  in  other  statements  of  record  may  be  rejected  under  35  U.S.C.§  112,  first  paragraph,  as  not  enabling.    In  re  Mayhew,  527  F.2d  1229,  188  USPQ  356  (CCPA  1976)”;  MPEP  §  2164.08(c).    (B)  is  incorrect.    As  stated  in  MPEP  §  2165,  “Failure  to  disclose  the best mode need not rise to the level of active concealment or grossly inequitable conduct inorder  to  support  a  rejection  or  invalidate  a  patent.    Where  an  inventor  knows  of  a  specificmaterial that will make possible the successful reproduction of the effects claimed by the patent, but does not disclose it, speaking instead in terms of broad categories, the best mode requirement has not been satisfied. Union Carbide Corp. v. Borg - Warner, 550 F.2d 555, 193 USPQ 1 (6th Cir. 1977).”  (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2165.01, part V indicates that if there is no disclosure ofthe  best  mode  contemplated  by  the  inventor  at  the  time  the  application  is  filed,  such  a  defect  cannot  be  cured  by  submitting  an  amendment  seeking  to  put  into  the  specification  something  required to be there when the patent application was originally filed.  In  re  Hay, 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976).  Any proposed amendment of this type should be treated as new matter.    MPEP  §  2165.01.    (E)  is  incorrect.    As  stated  in  MPEP  §  2165.02,  “The  best  mode  requirement  is  a  separate  and  distinct  requirement  from  the  enablement  requirement  of  the  first  paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.  In re Newton, 414 F.2d 1400, 163 USPQ 34 (CCPA 1969). 
11467	(B)  Failure  to  disclose  the  best  mode  must  rise  to  the  level  of  active  concealment  orgrossly inequitable conduct in order to support a rejection under 35 USC 112, first paragraph. 	1096	f	38. ANSWER:  (C) is the most correct answer.

Where  an  inventor  knows  of  a  specificmaterial that will make possible the successful reproduction of the effects claimed by the patent, but does not disclose it, speaking instead in terms of broad categories, the best mode requirement has not been satisfied. Union Carbide Corp. v. Borg - Warner, 550 F.2d 555, 193 USPQ 1 (6th Cir. 1977).”  (D) is incorrect.  MPEP § 2165.01, part V indicates that if there is no disclosure ofthe  best  mode  contemplated  by  the  inventor  at  the  time  the  application  is  filed,  such  a  defect  cannot  be  cured  by  submitting  an  amendment  seeking  to  put  into  the  specification  something  required to be there when the patent application was originally filed.  In  re  Hay, 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976).  Any proposed amendment of this type should be treated as new matter.    MPEP  §  2165.01.    (E)  is  incorrect.    As  stated  in  MPEP  §  2165.02,  “The  best  mode  requirement  is  a  separate  and  distinct  requirement  from  the  enablement  requirement  of  the  first  paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112.

(B)  If  the  application  is  a  continuation-in-part  of  an  earlier  U.S.  application,  any  claims  in  the  new  application  not  supported  by  the  specification  and  claims  of  the  parent  application  have  an  effective filing date equal to the filing date of the new application.  Any claims which are fully supported under 35 U.S.C. § 112 by the earlier parent application have the effective filing date ofthat earlier parent application.”  Accordingly, the effective filing date of claims 1-10 is 1995 andthe effective filing date of claims 11-15 is 2000.  Answers (A) and (B) are incorrect because they do not account for the two different effective filing dates.  Answers (C) and (D) are both correct,therefore answer (E) which includes both (C) and (D) is the most correct answer. 
11586	(C) III	1120	f	10. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 710.02(e), and 37 CFR § 1.136(a). (B) is incorrect because a Notice to File Missing Parts of an Application is not identified on the Notice as a statutory period subject to 35 U.S.C. § 133. (C) and (D) are incorrect because the provisions of 37 CFR § 1.136(a) are available. (E) is incorrect because (A) is correct.
11485	(E)(C) and (D).	1099	t	41. ANSWER:  (E) is the most correct answer.  MPEP § 706.02 page 700-20 (8th ed.), under the heading “DETERMINING THE EFFECTIVE FILING DATE OF THE APPLICATION” states “[t]he  effective  filing  date  of  a  U.S.  application  may  be  determined  as  follows:  ...

11486	(A)The evidence must compare the claimed invention to the closest prior art.	1100	f	42. ANSWER:  (D) is the most correct answer because mere attorney argument, unsupported by factual evidence, is insufficient to establish unexpected results.  See In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465,1470-71, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997).  (A) is not the proper choice because such a comparison is required.See In re Baxter Travenol Labs., 952 F.2d 388, 392, 21 USPQ2d 1281, 1285  (Fed.

(C)  is  not  theproper choice because the unobviousness of a broader range recited in a claim can be proven by a narrower range of data provided that one of ordinary skill in the art could ascertain a trend in the  data  which  would  allow  that  person  to  reasonably  extend  the  probative  value  of  the  data  tothe broader range.  See In re Kollman, 595 F.2d 48, 56, 201 USPQ 193, 199 (CCPA 1979), andMPEP § 717.02(d).  (E) is not the proper choice because the relied-upon evidence can be in thespecification.

See In re Soni, 54 F.3d 746, 750, 34 USPQ2d 1684, 1687 (Fed. Cir. 1995). 
11488	(C) Data relied upon to show unexpected results need not cover the full range of theclaims  if  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art  could  ascertain  a  trend  in  the  data  that  would  allow  that  person  to  reasonably  extend  the  probative  value  of  the  data  to  the full scope of the claims. 	1100	f	42.

11489	(D)Unexpected results can be shown by factual evidence or, if no factual evidence is available to the applicant, by sound argument by the applicant’s agent or attorney. 	1100	t	42. ANSWER:  (D) is the most correct answer because mere attorney argument, unsupported by factual evidence, is insufficient to establish unexpected results.  See In re Geisler, 116 F.3d 1465,1470-71, 43 USPQ2d 1362, 1365-66 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

11491	(A)cannot support a prima facie case of obviousness because T lacks a suggestion to combine with P for the purpose of preventing breakage in nylon rope. 	1101	f	43.   ANSWER:   (D).   “It   is   not   necessary   in   order   to   establish   aprima   facie   case   of   obviousness...that  there  be  a  suggestion  or  expectation  from  the  prior  art  that  the  claimed  [invention] will have the same or a similar utility as one newly discovered by the applicant.”  In re  Dillon,  919  F.2d  688,  692,  16  USPQ2d  1897,  1900  (Fed.

Thus,  “[i]t  is  not  necessary  that  the  prior  art  suggest  the  combination  to  achieve  the  same  advantage   or   result   discovered   by   applicant.”      MPEP   §   2144   (“Rationale   Different   from   Applicant’s  is  Permissible”).    Here,  T  suggests  the  combination  with  P  to  achieve  a  different  advantage  or  result,  i.e.,  waterproofing,  from  that  discovered  by  applicant,  i.e.,  reducing  breakage.    Answers  (A)  -  (C)  are  incorrect  because  the  suggestion  to  combine  does  not  need  to  be  for  the  same  purpose  as  applicant  discloses  in  the  application.    Dillon,  919 F.2d at 692, 16 USPQ2d at 1900; MPEP § 2144 (“Rationale Different  from  Applicant’s  is  Permissible”).Answer  (E)  is  incorrect  because  an  applicant  is  under  no  obligation  to  submit  evidence  of  non-obviousness  unless  the  examiner  meets  his  or  her  initial  burden  to  fully  establish  a  prima  faciecase of obviousness.

11504	(D)The assignee of record of a part interest in an application may always intervene in the prosecution of the application, appointing a registered attorney or agent of hisor her own choice, without participation by any or all other assignees. 	1103	t	45.  ANSWER:  The  best  choice  is  (D).    Choices  (A),  (B),  (C)  and  (E)  are  each  TRUE  statements.  See  MPEP  at  pp.  100-13,  100-12,  100-8  and  100-18,  respectively.    Choice  (D)  isNOT  TRUE  because  only  the  assignee  of  record  of  the  entire  interest  in  an  application  mayintervene in the prosecution of the application, appointing an attorney or agent of his or her ownchoice.  MPEP  at  p.  100-16.    An  assignee  of  record  of  a  part  interest  is,  however,  entitled  to  inspect the application. Id.
11573	(E)None of the above.	1117	t	7. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. (A) is incorrect since facts within the knowledge of the examiner may be used whether or not the examiner qualifies as an expert. 37 CFR § 1.104(c)(3). (B) is incorrect since the waiver is only effective against those named in the statutory registration. (C) is incorrect since on sale activities is not proper subject matter for reexamination, and inequitable conduct cannot be resolved or absolved by reexamination. (D) is not correct since a statutory bar cannot be overcome by acquiring the patent.
11494	(D)can  support  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness,  even  though  T  only  contains  a  suggestion to combine with P for the purpose of waterproofing nylon rope.	1101	t	43.   ANSWER:   (D).   “It   is   not   necessary   in   order   to   establish   aprima   facie   case   of   obviousness...that  there  be  a  suggestion  or  expectation  from  the  prior  art  that  the  claimed  [invention] will have the same or a similar utility as one newly discovered by the applicant.”  In re  Dillon,  919  F.2d  688,  692,  16  USPQ2d  1897,  1900  (Fed.

11495	(E)can  support  a  prima  facie  case  of  obviousness  because  the  applicant  is  always  under an obligation to submit evidence of non-obviousness regardless of whether the examiner fully establishes aprima facie case of obviousness. 	1101	f	43.   ANSWER:   (D).   “It   is   not   necessary   in   order   to   establish   aprima   facie   case   of   obviousness...that  there  be  a  suggestion  or  expectation  from  the  prior  art  that  the  claimed  [invention] will have the same or a similar utility as one newly discovered by the applicant.”  In re  Dillon,  919  F.2d  688,  692,  16  USPQ2d  1897,  1900  (Fed.

MPEP  §  706.02  (e).  (B) is incorrect because the invention is not described in a printed publication more than oneyear prior to the date of the U.S. application.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b).  (C) is incorrect because theinvention is not in public use more than one year prior to the date of the U.S. application.  MPEP§ 2133.  (D) is incorrect because the sale is not in the United States.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b); MPEP §§ 706.02(c) and 2133.03(d).  (E) is incorrect because (A) is correct.
11525	(E)None of the above. 	1107	f	49. ANSWER:  (A) is the correct answer.  35 U.S.C. § 102 (d), and MPEP § 706.02(c).  (A) is correct  because  the  foreign  patent  establishes  a  bar  under  35  U.S.C.  §102  (d).    MPEP  §  706.02  (e).  (B) is incorrect because the invention is not described in a printed publication more than oneyear prior to the date of the U.S. application.  35 U.S.C. § 102(b).  (C) is incorrect because theinvention is not in public use more than one year prior to the date of the U.S. application.  MPEP§ 2133.

11526	(A)The inventions disclosed by Larry and Morris cannot be physically combined.	1108	f	50.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    “The  mere  fact  that  references  can  be  combined  or  modified  does  not  render  the  resultant  combination  obvious  unless  the  prior  art  also  suggests  thedesirability of the combination.”  MPEP § 2143.01 (citing In re Mills, 916 F.2d 680, 16 USPQ2d 1430  (Fed.  Cir.  1990)).    Here,  the  examiner  fails  to  show  that  substituting  Larry’s  device  for  another  type  of  device  in  Morris    would  have  been  desirable.  (A)  is  incorrect.    The  test  ofobviousness is not whether the features or elements of the references are physically combinable.  In  re  Keller,  642  F.2d  413,  425,  208  USPQ  871,  881  (CCPA  1981);  In  re  Sneed,  710  F.2d  1544,1550,  218  USPQ  385,389  (Fed.  Cir.  1983).    (B)  is  incorrect.    “The  rationale  to  modify  orcombine the prior art does not have to be expressly stated in the prior art; the rationale may be expressly or impliedly contained in the prior art or it may be reasoned from knowledge generally available  to  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  established  scientific  principles,  or  legal  precedent  established by prior case law.”  MPEP § 2144 (citingIn re Fine, 837 F.2d 1071, 5 USPQ2d 1596(Fed.  Cir.  1988);  In  re  Jones,  958  F.2d  347,  21  USPQ2d  1941  (Fed.  Cir.  1992)).    Here,  theargument  overlooks  the  fact  that  a  suggestion  to  combine  Larry  and  Morris  may  be  reasoned  from  knowledge  generally  available  to  one  of  ordinary  skill  in  the  art,  established  scientificprinciples,  or  legal  precedent  established  by  prior  case  law.    (C)  is  incorrect.    “The  fact  that  a  combination  would  not  be  made  by  businessmen  for  economic  reasons  does  not  mean  that  a  person   of   ordinary   skill   in   the   art   would   not   make   the   combination   because   of   some   technological incompatibility.”  MPEP § 2145 (citingIn re Farrenkopf, 713 F.2d 714, 718, 219 USPQ 1, 4 (Fed. Cir. 1983)).  Here, the high cost of Barry’s device does not teach away from a person of ordinary skill in the art combining it with Lance’s device.  
11527	(B)   Neither   Larry   nor   Morris   provides   an   express   suggestion   to   combine   the   references.  	1108	f	50.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    “The  mere  fact  that  references  can  be  combined  or  modified  does  not  render  the  resultant  combination  obvious  unless  the  prior  art  also  suggests  thedesirability of the combination.”  MPEP § 2143.01 (citing In re Mills, 916 F.2d 680, 16 USPQ2d 1430  (Fed.

Cir. 1983)).  Here, the high cost of Barry’s device does not teach away from a person of ordinary skill in the art combining it with Lance’s device.  
11528	(C) As recognized by businessmen, the high cost of Larry’s device teaches away from combining it with the simpler device of Morris.	1108	f	50.  ANSWER:  (D)  is  correct.    “The  mere  fact  that  references  can  be  combined  or  modified  does  not  render  the  resultant  combination  obvious  unless  the  prior  art  also  suggests  thedesirability of the combination.”  MPEP § 2143.01 (citing In re Mills, 916 F.2d 680, 16 USPQ2d 1430  (Fed.

(B) is incorrect. Such a mistake, which affects the scope and meaning of the claims in a patent, is not considered to be of the “minor” character required for issuance of a Certificate of Correction. MPEP § 1481.
11592	(D)Through error and without deceptive intent, an inventor’s name is omitted from an issued patent, a petition under 37 CFR 1.324 and appropriate fees were filed, and the petition was granted.	1121	f	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. (A) and (C) can be corrected by a certificate of Correction. MPEP § 1481. (D) can be corrected by a Certificate of Correction. 37 CFR § 1.324; MPEP § 1481. (B) is incorrect. Such a mistake, which affects the scope and meaning of the claims in a patent, is not considered to be of the “minor” character required for issuance of a Certificate of Correction. MPEP § 1481.
11593	(E)(A), (C) and (D).	1121	t	11. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. (A) and (C) can be corrected by a certificate of Correction. MPEP § 1481. (D) can be corrected by a Certificate of Correction. 37 CFR § 1.324; MPEP § 1481. (B) is incorrect.

11599	(A) if the limitation now being added in the present reissue was originally presented/argued/stated in the original application to make the claims allowable over a rejection or objection made in the original application.	1123	f	13. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct. See MPEP § 1412.02, Recapture. As to (A), recapture occurs when the claim is broadened. Adding a limitation would narrow the claim. As to (B), recapture does not apply to continuations. As to (D), the two-year date relates to broadening reissue applications, not to the issue of recapture. 35 U.S.C. 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues: “No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent.” (E) is incorrect because a (C) is correct.
11600	(B) if the limitation now being omitted or broadened in the present continuation was originally presented/argued/stated in a parent application to make the claims allowable over a rejection or objection made in the parent application.	1123	f	13. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct. See MPEP § 1412.02, Recapture. As to (A), recapture occurs when the claim is broadened. Adding a limitation would narrow the claim. As to (B), recapture does not apply to continuations. As to (D), the two-year date relates to broadening reissue applications, not to the issue of recapture. 35 U.S.C. 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues: “No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent.” (E) is incorrect because a (C) is correct.
11601	(C) if the limitation now being omitted or broadened in the present reissue was originally presented/argued/stated in the original application to make the claims allowable over a rejection or objection made in the original application.	1123	t	13. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct. See MPEP § 1412.02, Recapture. As to (A), recapture occurs when the claim is broadened. Adding a limitation would narrow the claim. As to (B), recapture does not apply to continuations. As to (D), the two-year date relates to broadening reissue applications, not to the issue of recapture. 35 U.S.C. 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues: “No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent.” (E) is incorrect because a (C) is correct.
11602	(D) if the limitation now being omitted or broadened in the present reissue was being broadened for the first time more than two years after the issuance of the original patent.	1123	f	13. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct. See MPEP § 1412.02, Recapture. As to (A), recapture occurs when the claim is broadened. Adding a limitation would narrow the claim. As to (B), recapture does not apply to continuations. As to (D), the two-year date relates to broadening reissue applications, not to the issue of recapture. 35 U.S.C. 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues: “No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent.” (E) is incorrect because a (C) is correct.
11603	(E)None of the above.	1123	f	13. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct. See MPEP § 1412.02, Recapture. As to (A), recapture occurs when the claim is broadened. Adding a limitation would narrow the claim. As to (B), recapture does not apply to continuations. As to (D), the two-year date relates to broadening reissue applications, not to the issue of recapture. 35 U.S.C. 251 prescribes a 2-year limit for filing applications for broadening reissues: “No reissue patent shall be granted enlarging the scope of the original patent unless applied for within two years from the grant of the original patent.” (E) is incorrect because a (C) is correct.
11609	(A)The final Office action rejection is in a second Office action and uses newly cited art under 35 USC 102 to reject unamended claims that were objected to but not rejected in a first Office action.	1125	f	15. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 706.07(b). (A) is incorrect because a final rejection is not proper on a second action if it includes a rejection on newly cited art other than information submitted in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c). MPEP § 706.07(a). (B) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where any claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application. MPEP § 706.07(b). (D) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a substitute application where that application contains material, which was presented in the earlier application after final rejection, or closing of prosecution but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised. MPEP § 706.07(b). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11610	(B) The final Office action rejection is in a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where at least one claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application.	1125	f	15. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 706.07(b). (A) is incorrect because a final rejection is not proper on a second action if it includes a rejection on newly cited art other than information submitted in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c). MPEP § 706.07(a). (B) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where any claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application. MPEP § 706.07(b). (D) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a substitute application where that application contains material, which was presented in the earlier application after final rejection, or closing of prosecution but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised. MPEP § 706.07(b). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.

11637	(D)The examiner’s rejection of the claims to the microorganism under 35 USC102/103 over a reference which teaches an S. spectaculus microorganism stating that Eric’s claimed microorganism is the same as, or substantially the same as, the microorganism described in the prior art.	1130	t	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131. MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).” Here, the claimed microorganism and the prior art microorganism appear to be the identical. (A) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2105, under the heading “Patentable Subject Matter – Living Subject Matter,” states “...the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability.” The Supreme Court has held that biological materials such as microorganisms, and non-human animals, is patentable subject matter, provided it is made by man. Here, Eric’s isolation and purification the microorganism from its natural state (environment) makes it a product of human ingenuity, as opposed to a product of nature. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980). (B) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “III. Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” states that the “courts have found utility for therapeutic invention despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or bioactive compound or composition.” See, Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also, In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Citing Brana, MPEP § 2107.01 states, “Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe 35 USC 101, under the logic of ‘practical’ utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans.” See also, MPEP § 2107.03, under the heading “Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utilities, I. A Reasonable Correlation Between the Evidence and the Asserted Utility is Sufficient,” which states “As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility. Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Jolles, 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 206 F.2d 881 (CCPA 1981). An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use.” Since mice are routinely used to test anti-cancer drugs for their tumoricidal activity, it is reasonable to assume that the compound, spectaculysem, may be useful as a therapeutic agent. (C) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2145, under the subheading “X. Arguing Improper Rationales for Combining References. A. Impermissible Hindsight.” If, as acknowledged by the examiner, a novel microorganism has been discovered, then any product which it makes could not have been anticipated by, or obvious over, the prior art. The examiner’s rejection is based purely on hindsight derived from his or her reading of the applicant’s specification.
11650	(B) Encouraging the client to meet with an opposing party for settlement discussions.	1133	t	23. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See 37 CFR § 10.87. As to (A), practitioner may not limit damages under 37 CFR § 10.78. As to (C), see 37 CFR § 10.89(b)(1). As to (D), see 37 CFR § 10.89(c)(4). As to (E), see 37 CFR § 10.112(a) where client funds advanced for legal services are required to be deposited in a bank account.
11611	(C) The final Office action rejection is in a first Office action in a continuing application, all claims are drawn to the same invention claimed in the parent application, and the claims would have been properly finally rejected on the grounds and art of record in the next Office action if they had been entered in the parent application.	1125	t	15. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 706.07(b). (A) is incorrect because a final rejection is not proper on a second action if it includes a rejection on newly cited art other than information submitted in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c). MPEP § 706.07(a). (B) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where any claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application. MPEP § 706.07(b). (D) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a substitute application where that application contains material, which was presented in the earlier application after final rejection, or closing of prosecution but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised. MPEP § 706.07(b). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11612	(D) The final Office action rejection is in a first Office action in a substitute application that contains material that was presented after final rejection in an earlier application but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised.	1125	f	15. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 706.07(b). (A) is incorrect because a final rejection is not proper on a second action if it includes a rejection on newly cited art other than information submitted in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c). MPEP § 706.07(a). (B) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where any claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application. MPEP § 706.07(b). (D) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a substitute application where that application contains material, which was presented in the earlier application after final rejection, or closing of prosecution but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised. MPEP § 706.07(b). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11613	(E)None of the above.	1125	f	15. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 706.07(b). (A) is incorrect because a final rejection is not proper on a second action if it includes a rejection on newly cited art other than information submitted in an information disclosure statement under 37 CFR 1.97(c). MPEP § 706.07(a). (B) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a continuation-in-part application where any claim includes subject matter not present in the parent application. MPEP § 706.07(b). (D) is incorrect because it is improper to make final a first Office action in a substitute application where that application contains material, which was presented in the earlier application after final rejection, or closing of prosecution but was denied entry because the issue of new matter was raised. MPEP § 706.07(b). (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11619	(A) A claim to a process omitting a step in a disclosed process, where the step is disclosed in the specification to be essential to the invention, may not be properly rejected under 35 USC 112(a), for lack of enablement where the specification provides an enabling disclosure only for the process which includes the essential step.	1127	f	17. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails to interrelate essential elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), for failure to point out and distinctly claim the invention. See In re Venezia, 530 F.2d 956, 189 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1976); In re Collier, 397 F.2d 1003, 158 USPQ 266 (CCPA 1968).” (A) is incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “A claim which omits matter disclosed to be essential to the invention as described in the specification or in other statements of record may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a), as not enabling. In re Mayhew, 527 F.2d 1229, 188 USPQ 356 (CCPA 1976)”; MPEP § 2164.08(c). (B) is incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2165, “Failure to disclose the best mode need not rise to the level of active concealment or grossly inequitable conduct in order to support a rejection or invalidate a patent. Where an inventor knows of a specific material that will make possible the successful reproduction of the effects claimed by the patent, but does not disclose it, the best mode requirement has not been satisfied. Union Carbide Corp. v. Borg - Warner, 550 F.2d 555, 193 USPQ 1 (6th Cir. 1977).” (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 2165.01, under the heading “Defect In Best Mode Cannot Be Cured By New Matter,” indicates that if there is no disclosure of the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the time the application is filed, such a defect cannot be cured by submitting an amendment seeking to put into the specification something required to be there when the patent application was originally filed. In re Hay, 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976). Any proposed amendment of this type should be treated as new matter. MPEP § 2165.01. (E) is incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2165.02, “The best mode requirement is a separate and distinct requirement from the enablement requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112. In re Newton, 414 F.2d 1400, 163 USPQ 34 (CCPA 1969).
11623	(E) The best mode requirement is the same as the enablement requirement of 35 USC 112(a).	1127	f	17. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails to interrelate essential elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), for failure to point out and distinctly claim the invention.

11624	(A) Where sole patent applicant Able claims his invention in a Jepson-type claim, and the specification discloses that the subject matter of the preamble was invented by Baker before applicant’s invention, the preamble is properly treated as prior art.	1128	t	18. ANSWER: (A) is true, and thus the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2129, and see In re Fout, 675 F.2d 297, 300-01, 213 USPQ 532,535-36 (CCPA 1982). (B) is not true, and thus not correct. MPEP § 2129, and see Reading & Bates Construction Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Corp., 748 F.2d 645, 650, 223 USPQ 1168, 1172 (Fed. Cir. 1984). (C) is not true, and thus not correct because the admitted foundational discovery is a statutory bar. See the reasons discussed for answer (B). (D) is not true, and is thus incorrect. MPEP § 2129, and see In re Nomiya, 184 USPQ 607, 610 (CCPA 1975) (figures in the application labeled “prior art” held to be an admission that what was pictured was prior art relative to applicant’s invention.). (E) is not true. MPEP § 2129; and see In re Ehrreich, 590 F.2d 902, 909 – 910, 200 USPQ 504, 510 (CCPA 1979); Sjolund v. Musland, 847 F.2d 1573, 1577, 6 USPQ2d 2020, 2023 (Fed.

11638	(E)None of the above.	1130	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131. MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established.

MPEP § 2165.01, under the heading “Defect In Best Mode Cannot Be Cured By New Matter,” indicates that if there is no disclosure of the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the time the application is filed, such a defect cannot be cured by submitting an amendment seeking to put into the specification something required to be there when the patent application was originally filed. In re Hay, 534 F.2d 917, 189 USPQ 790 (CCPA 1976). Any proposed amendment of this type should be treated as new matter. MPEP § 2165.01. (E) is incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2165.02, “The best mode requirement is a separate and distinct requirement from the enablement requirement of the first paragraph of 35 U.S.C. § 112. In re Newton, 414 F.2d 1400, 163 USPQ 34 (CCPA 1969).
11621	(C) A claim failing to interrelate essential elements of the invention, as defined by the applicant in the specification, where the interrelation is critical to the invention may be properly rejected under 35 USC 112(b), for failure to properly point out and distinctly claim the invention.	1127	t	17. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails to interrelate essential elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), for failure to point out and distinctly claim the invention.

As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “A claim which omits matter disclosed to be essential to the invention as described in the specification or in other statements of record may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. § 112(a), as not enabling. In re Mayhew, 527 F.2d 1229, 188 USPQ 356 (CCPA 1976)”; MPEP § 2164.08(c). (B) is incorrect. As stated in MPEP § 2165, “Failure to disclose the best mode need not rise to the level of active concealment or grossly inequitable conduct in order to support a rejection or invalidate a patent. Where an inventor knows of a specific material that will make possible the successful reproduction of the effects claimed by the patent, but does not disclose it, the best mode requirement has not been satisfied.

11622	(D) Where the best mode contemplated by the inventor at the time of filing the application is not disclosed, a proposed amendment adding a specific mode of practicing the invention would not be new matter.	1127	f	17. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2172.01, “a claim which fails to interrelate essential elements of the invention as defined by applicant(s) in the specification may be rejected under 35 U.S.C. 112(a), for failure to point out and distinctly claim the invention.

11625	(B) Where the sole patent applicant Able claims his invention in a Jepson-type claim, and the specification makes it clear that the claimed invention is an improvement on Able’s own prior invention, which Able discovered less than one year before the filing date of the application, the preamble in the claim is properly treated as prior art.	1128	f	18. ANSWER: (A) is true, and thus the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2129, and see In re Fout, 675 F.2d 297, 300-01, 213 USPQ 532,535-36 (CCPA 1982). (B) is not true, and thus not correct.

11626	(C) Where the sole patent applicant Able claims his invention in a Jepson-type claim, and the specification makes it clear that the claimed invention is an improvement on an invention that Able discovered and publicly used and commercially sold by Able in Texas for several years before the filing date of the application, the preamble in the claim cannot properly be treated as prior art.	1128	f	18. ANSWER: (A) is true, and thus the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2129, and see In re Fout, 675 F.2d 297, 300-01, 213 USPQ 532,535-36 (CCPA 1982). (B) is not true, and thus not correct.

11627	(D)Where the sole applicant, Baker, states that something is prior art, the statement can be taken as being admitted prior art only if corroborated by objective evidence proffered by Baker, or found by the examiner.	1128	f	18. ANSWER: (A) is true, and thus the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2129, and see In re Fout, 675 F.2d 297, 300-01, 213 USPQ 532,535-36 (CCPA 1982). (B) is not true, and thus not correct.

11628	(E) No claim, including a Jepson-type claim, carries with it an implied admission that the elements in the preamble are old in the art.	1128	f	18. ANSWER: (A) is true, and thus the most correct answer. As stated in MPEP § 2129, and see In re Fout, 675 F.2d 297, 300-01, 213 USPQ 532,535-36 (CCPA 1982). (B) is not true, and thus not correct.

11629	(A) A request for an interview in a substitute application prior to the first Office action, for the examiner and attorney of record to meet in the practitioner’s office without the authority of the Director.	1129	f	19. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.133; MPEP § 713.02. As stated in MPEP § 713.02, “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications. A request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (A) is incorrect because interview will not be permitted off Office premises without the authority of the Commissioner. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(1). (C) is incorrect because an interview for the discussion of the patentability of a pending application will not occur before the first Office action, unless the application is a continuing or substitute application or the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2). (D) is incorrect because (A) and (C) are incorrect. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.
11634	(A)The examiner’s rejection of the claims to the microorganism under 35 USC 101 as being unpatentable because microorganisms are living matter and living matter is non-statutory subject matter.	1130	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131. MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).” Here, the claimed microorganism and the prior art microorganism appear to be the identical. (A) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2105, under the heading “Patentable Subject Matter – Living Subject Matter,” states “...the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability.” The Supreme Court has held that biological materials such as microorganisms, and non-human animals, is patentable subject matter, provided it is made by man. Here, Eric’s isolation and purification the microorganism from its natural state (environment) makes it a product of human ingenuity, as opposed to a product of nature. Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980). (B) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2107.01, under the heading “III. Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utility,” states that the “courts have found utility for therapeutic invention despite the fact that an applicant is at a very early stage in the development of a pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or bioactive compound or composition.” See, Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also, In re Brana, 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Citing Brana, MPEP § 2107.01 states, “Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe 35 USC 101, under the logic of ‘practical’ utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans.” See also, MPEP § 2107.03, under the heading “Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utilities, I. A Reasonable Correlation Between the Evidence and the Asserted Utility is Sufficient,” which states “As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility. Cross v. Iizuka, 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); In re Jolles, 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); Nelson v. Bowler, 626 F.2d 853, 206 F.2d 881 (CCPA 1981). An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use.” Since mice are routinely used to test anti-cancer drugs for their tumoricidal activity, it is reasonable to assume that the compound, spectaculysem, may be useful as a therapeutic agent. (C) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2145, under the subheading “X. Arguing Improper Rationales for Combining References. A. Impermissible Hindsight.” If, as acknowledged by the examiner, a novel microorganism has been discovered, then any product which it makes could not have been anticipated by, or obvious over, the prior art. The examiner’s rejection is based purely on hindsight derived from his or her reading of the applicant’s specification.
11644	(A)An argument that the claimed product has an unexpectedly low melting point of 150° F, supported by an affidavit showing that the mixture Y made by process Q2 exhibits a melting point of 300° F.	1132	t	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer. The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual. Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C). (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B). (E) is not the most correct answer. Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).
11731	(C) Filing an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.131 showing prior invention, if the reference is not a U.S. patent that either claims the same invention or claims an obvious variation of the subject matter in the rejected claim(s).	1152	f	see MPEP 706.02(b)(1)
11630	(B)A request for an interview in a continued prosecution application prior to the first Office action, to be held in the examiner’s office.	1129	t	19. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.133; MPEP § 713.02. As stated in MPEP § 713.02, “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications. A request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (A) is incorrect because interview will not be permitted off Office premises without the authority of the Commissioner. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(1). (C) is incorrect because an interview for the discussion of the patentability of a pending application will not occur before the first Office action, unless the application is a continuing or substitute application or the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2). (D) is incorrect because (A) and (C) are incorrect. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.
11635	(B) The examiner’s rejection of the claims to the compound under 35 USC 101 as having no credible utility because Eric has only tested the compound in mice and curing mice of cancer has no “real world” value. The examiner also states that Eric must demonstrate that the compound works in humans in order to show that it has a patentable utility.	1130	f	20. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP §§ 2112.01 and 2131. MPEP § 2112.01, under the heading “Product and Apparatus Claims – When the Structure Recited in the Reference is Substantially Identical to that of the Claims, Claimed Properties or Functions are Presumed to be Inherent” states that “[w]here the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a prima facie case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. In re Best, 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977).” Here, the claimed microorganism and the prior art microorganism appear to be the identical. (A) is an incorrect choice. MPEP § 2105, under the heading “Patentable Subject Matter – Living Subject Matter,” states “...the question of whether or not an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patentability.” The Supreme Court has held that biological materials such as microorganisms, and non-human animals, is patentable subject matter, provided it is made by man.

Impermissible Hindsight.” If, as acknowledged by the examiner, a novel microorganism has been discovered, then any product which it makes could not have been anticipated by, or obvious over, the prior art. The examiner’s rejection is based purely on hindsight derived from his or her reading of the applicant’s specification.
11631	(C) A request for an interview in a non-continuing and non-substitute application, prior to the first Office action to be held in the examiner’s office and without the examiner determining that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application.	1129	f	19. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.133; MPEP § 713.02. As stated in MPEP § 713.02, “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications. A request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (A) is incorrect because interview will not be permitted off Office premises without the authority of the Commissioner. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(1). (C) is incorrect because an interview for the discussion of the patentability of a pending application will not occur before the first Office action, unless the application is a continuing or substitute application or the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2). (D) is incorrect because (A) and (C) are incorrect. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.
11632	(D)All of the above.	1129	f	19. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.133; MPEP § 713.02. As stated in MPEP § 713.02, “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications. A request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (A) is incorrect because interview will not be permitted off Office premises without the authority of the Commissioner. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(1). (C) is incorrect because an interview for the discussion of the patentability of a pending application will not occur before the first Office action, unless the application is a continuing or substitute application or the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2). (D) is incorrect because (A) and (C) are incorrect. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.
11645	(B)An argument that the processes used by applicant and patent A are different, supported by a third-party declaration stating only that the processes are different.	1132	f	22. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Product-By-Process Claims Are Not Limited To The Manipulations Of The Recited Steps, Only The Structure Implied By The Steps,” states “‘even though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process.’ In re Thorpe, 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985).” The issue is whether the claimed mixture Y is the same as or obvious over the patented mixture Y. MPEP § 2113, under the heading “Once A Product Appearing To Be Substantially Identical Is Found And A 35 U.S.C. 102/103 Rejection Made, The Burden Shifts To The Applicant To Show An Unobvious Difference,” states “[o]nce the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an unobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. In re Marosi, 710 F.2d 798, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983).” Evidence that the two processes produce different properties is germane to the issue of patentability of the product-by-process claim. Accordingly, a comparison of the results obtained by conducting the process recited in the claim versus the process used by patent A and which shows that the claimed product exhibits an unexpectedly lower melting point would be a persuasive demonstration that, although the products would appear to be substantially identical, in fact, they are patentably different. Ex parte Gray, 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989). Therefore, the best reply to the outstanding rejection would be to argue that the claimed product has an unexpectedly lower melting point and to support that argument with evidence showing that the result of the patent A process is a mixture with higher melting point as compared to the claimed product. (B) is not the most correct answer. The patentability of a product-by-process claim is determined on the basis of product characteristics, not process steps. (C) is not the most correct answer. The declaration is conclusory, as opposed to being factual. Thus, the argument is not supported by facts. As stated in MPEP § 716.02(c), under the heading “Opinion Evidence,” “Although an affidavit or declaration which states only conclusions may have some probative value, such an affidavit or declaration may have little weight when considered in light of all the evidence of record in the application. In re Brandstadter, 484 F.2d 1395, 179 USPQ 286 (CCPA 1973).” Thus, the reply in (A) is the most correct answer vis-à-vis (C). (D) like answer (B), is not the most correct answer for the same reason discussed for (B). (E) is not the most correct answer. Like answer (C), this reply rightly focuses on product properties. But without the comparative factual evidence to support it, this reply is weaker than one described in answer (A).
11652	(D)In reply to an Office action, stating honestly and truthfully in the remarks accompanying an amendment that the practitioner has personally used the device and found it to be very efficient and better than the prior art.	1133	f	23. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See 37 CFR § 10.87. As to (A), practitioner may not limit damages under 37 CFR § 10.78. As to (C), see 37 CFR § 10.89(b)(1). As to (D), see 37 CFR § 10.89(c)(4). As to (E), see 37 CFR § 10.112(a) where client funds advanced for legal services are required to be deposited in a bank account.

As to (D), see 37 CFR § 10.89(c)(4). As to (E), see 37 CFR § 10.112(a) where client funds advanced for legal services are required to be deposited in a bank account.
11687	(D)In general, supplemental application data sheets may be subsequently supplied prior to payment of the issue fee either to correct or update information in a previously submitted application data sheet.	1142	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(3) provides, “(3)The Office will capture bibliographic information from the application data sheet. The Office will generally not review the inventor’s oath or declaration to determine if the bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the bibliographic information provided in an application data sheet. Incorrect bibliographic information contained in an application data sheet may be corrected as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. ”
11716	(C) Upon written request, a person citing patents and printed publications to the Office that the person believes has a bearing on the patentability of a particular patent, may request that his or her name remain confidential.	1148	f	38. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As to (B), see MPEP §§ 2203 and 2212. As to (D), the claim for priority is not required, as a person may not wish to do so in order to increase the term of his or her patent. As to (A) deferral under 37 CFR § 1.103 is not available following the notice of allowance. Since (B) and (C) are correct, (E) is the best answer.
11719	(A) A specification.	1150	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b). 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.” The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11721	(C) An application fee.	1150	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b). 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.” The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11633	(E)None of the above.	1129	f	19. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 37 CFR § 1.133; MPEP § 713.02. As stated in MPEP § 713.02, “[a] request for an interview prior to the first Office action is ordinarily granted in continuing or substitute applications. A request for an interview in all other applications before the first action is untimely and will not be acknowledged if written, or granted if oral. 37 CFR 1.133(a).” (A) is incorrect because interview will not be permitted off Office premises without the authority of the Commissioner. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(1). (C) is incorrect because an interview for the discussion of the patentability of a pending application will not occur before the first Office action, unless the application is a continuing or substitute application or the examiner determines that such an interview would advance prosecution of the application. 37 CFR § 1.133(a)(2). (D) is incorrect because (A) and (C) are incorrect. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.
11639	(A) An objection and requirement to delete new matter from the specification is subject to supervisory review by petition under 37 CFR 1.181.	1131	f	21. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 2163.06, under the heading “Review Of New Matter Objections And Rejections,” states “[a] rejection of claims is reviewable by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, whereas an objection and requirement to delete new matter is subject to supervisory review by petition under 37 CFR 1.181. If both the claims and specification contain new matter either directly or indirectly, and there has been both a rejection and objection by the examiner, the issue becomes appealable and should not be decided by petition.” Answer (C) is not in accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP.

11659	(A)Remand for a fuller description of the claimed invention.	1135	f	25. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1211.02. (D) is not a proper basis for remand because the Board has no authority to require the examiner to consider an affidavit which has not been entered after final rejection and which was filed while the application was pending before the examiner. Pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.195, “[a]ffidavits...submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted without a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented.” The facts are silent regarding whether such a showing was made. However, as discussed in MPEP § 715.09, “Review of an examiner’s refusal to enter [and consider] an affidavit as untimely is by petition and not by appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In re Deters, 515 F.2d 1152, 185 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1975); Ex parte Hale, 49 USPQ 209 (Bd. App. 1941).” Thus, remand by the Board cannot be expected.

11661	(C) Remand for a selection by the primary examiner of a preferred or best ground of rejection when multiple rejections of a cumulative nature have been made by the examiner.	1135	f	25. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1211.02. (D) is not a proper basis for remand because the Board has no authority to require the examiner to consider an affidavit which has not been entered after final rejection and which was filed while the application was pending before the examiner. Pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.195, “[a]ffidavits...submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted without a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented.” The facts are silent regarding whether such a showing was made.

Support for each of answers (A), (B), (C) and (E) is specifically provided for in MPEP § 1211.
11662	(D) Remand to the primary examiner with instructions to consider an affidavit not entered by the examiner which was filed after the final rejection but before the appeal.	1135	t	25. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1211.02. (D) is not a proper basis for remand because the Board has no authority to require the examiner to consider an affidavit which has not been entered after final rejection and which was filed while the application was pending before the examiner.

11663	(E)Remand to the primary examiner to prepare a supplemental examiner’s answer in response to a reply brief.	1135	f	25. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1211.02. (D) is not a proper basis for remand because the Board has no authority to require the examiner to consider an affidavit which has not been entered after final rejection and which was filed while the application was pending before the examiner. Pursuant to 37 CFR § 1.195, “[a]ffidavits...submitted after the case has been appealed will not be admitted without a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they were not earlier presented.” The facts are silent regarding whether such a showing was made. However, as discussed in MPEP § 715.09, “Review of an examiner’s refusal to enter [and consider] an affidavit as untimely is by petition and not by appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. In re Deters, 515 F.2d 1152, 185 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1975); Ex parte Hale, 49 USPQ 209 (Bd. App. 1941).” Thus, remand by the Board cannot be expected.

MPEP § 410 states "The first certification has permitted the USPTO to eliminate the separate verification requirement previously contained in several rules for statements of facts by persons who are not registered to practice before the USPTO. As statements submitted to the USPTO by any person are now, by operation of 37 CFR 11.18(b)(1), verified statements, a separate verification requirement is no longer necessary. The USPTO, however, has retained the verification requirement for a statement to be submitted under oath or declaration (37 CFR 1.68) in a number of sections (e.g., 37 CFR 1.63, 1.64, 1.130, 1.131, 1.132, 1.495(f), and 5.25). "
11684	(A) An application data sheet is a sheet or sheets that may be voluntarily submitted in either provisional or nonprovisional applications, which contains bibliographic data, arranged in a format specified by the Office. If an application data sheet is provided, the application data sheet is part of the provisional or nonprovisional application for which it has been submitted.	1142	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(3) provides, “(3)The Office will capture bibliographic information from the application data sheet. The Office will generally not review the inventor’s oath or declaration to determine if the bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the bibliographic information provided in an application data sheet. Incorrect bibliographic information contained in an application data sheet may be corrected as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. ”
11685	(B) Bibliographic data on an application data sheet includes: (1) applicant information, (2) correspondence information, (3) application information, (4)representative information, (5) domestic priority information, (6) foreign priority information, and (7) assignee information.	1142	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(3) provides, “(3)The Office will capture bibliographic information from the application data sheet. The Office will generally not review the inventor’s oath or declaration to determine if the bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the bibliographic information provided in an application data sheet. Incorrect bibliographic information contained in an application data sheet may be corrected as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. ”

11688	(E) The Office will initially capture bibliographic information from the application data sheet notwithstanding whether an oath or declaration governs the information. Thus, the Office shall generally not look to an oath or declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 to see if the bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the bibliographic information captured from an application data sheet (whether the oath or declaration is submitted prior to or subsequent to the application data sheet).	1142	f	32. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. This is not true since 37 CFR § 1.76(d)(3) provides, “(3)The Office will capture bibliographic information from the application data sheet. The Office will generally not review the inventor’s oath or declaration to determine if the bibliographic information contained therein is consistent with the bibliographic information provided in an application data sheet. Incorrect bibliographic information contained in an application data sheet may be corrected as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. ”
11689	(A)The Lancer patent discloses and claims an electric toothbrush, but does not mention whether its toothbrush includes a power supply.	1143	t	33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers. Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....” See MPEP § 2131, citing In re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990). In (E), the on/off switch of Lancer’s toothbrush is arranged differently than that of the claimed toothbrush. (A) is accepted as correct because the given facts do not specify the location of the power supply as being included within the toothbrush. Though the description of the toothbrush as being electric can imply an inherent source of power, it may also may imply an external power source for the electric toothbrush. Accordingly, (A) is also accepted as a correct answer in the circumstances. (B) is incorrect because evidence of secondary considerations, such as commercial success, is irrelevant to a 35 U.S.C. § 102 rejection. See MPEP § 2131.04. (C) is incorrect. “‘Arguments that the alleged anticipatory prior art...‘teaches away from the invention’...[are] not ‘germane’ to a rejection under section 102.’” MPEP § 2131.05 (quoting Twin Disc, Inc. v. United States, 231 USPQ 417, 424 (Cl. Ct. 1986)). (D) is incorrect. “The term ‘others’ in 35 U.S.C. 102(a) refers to any entity which is different from the inventive entity. The entity need only differ by one person to be ‘by others.’ This holds true for all types of references eligible as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a) including publications....” MPEP § 2132. Here, because Lancer is only one of three inventors of the claim, the patent is by others. 33. ANSWER: (A) and (E) are accepted as correct answers. Regarding (E), see MPEP § 2131. To anticipate a claim, the elements of a reference “must be arranged as required by the claim....” See MPEP § 2131, citing In re Bond, 910 F.2d 831, 15 USPQ2d 1566 (Fed. Cir. 1990).

11699	(A) Record in the USPTO an assignment of all right, title, and interest in the patent to the public, conditioned on the receipt by Igor of all royalties from licensing the patent after the first five years of the patent term.	1145	f	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.” 35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.” (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes. (B) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) provides for dedication to the public of “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” only. “[T]he first five years of the patent term” does not qualify as a terminal part of the term. (C) is wrong because Igor would not achieve his objective of dedicating at least a portion of his patent term to the public, since the term of the design patent would expire on January 23, 2030. 35 U.S.C. § 173. (D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent. “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).
11700	(B) File a disclaimer in the USPTO dedicating to the public the first five years of the patent term.	1145	f	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.” 35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.” (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.

(D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent. “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).
11702	(D) File a disclaimer in the USPTO dedicating to the public half of all royalties received from licensing the patent for the terminal part of the term of the patent.	1145	f	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.” 35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.” (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.

(C) is wrong because Igor would not achieve his objective of dedicating at least a portion of his patent term to the public, since the term of the design patent would expire on January 23, 2030. 35 U.S.C. § 173. (D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent. “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).
11701	(C) File a disclaimer in the USPTO dedicating to the public that portion of the term of the patent from January 24, 2030 to January 24, 2035.	1145	f	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.” 35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.” (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.

(C) is wrong because Igor would not achieve his objective of dedicating at least a portion of his patent term to the public, since the term of the design patent would expire on January 23, 2030. 35 U.S.C. § 173. (D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent. “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).
11718	(E)Each of statements (B) and (C) is true.	1148	t	38. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As to (B), see MPEP §§ 2203 and 2212. As to (D), the claim for priority is not required, as a person may not wish to do so in order to increase the term of his or her patent. As to (A) deferral under 37 CFR § 1.103 is not available following the notice of allowance. Since (B) and (C) are correct, (E) is the best answer.
11720	(B) A drawing as prescribed by 35 USC 113.	1150	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b). 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.” The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11722	(D) A claim.	1150	t	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b). 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.” The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11723	(E) A cover sheet complying with the rule.	1150	f	40. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2); 37 CFR § 1.51(c); MPEP §§ 601 and 601.01(b). 35 U.S.C. § 111(b)(2) states that “[a] claim, as required by the second through fifth paragraphs of section 112, shall not be required in a provisional application.” The documents and other components recited in answers (A) through (C) and (E) are required in a provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. § 111(b); 37 CFR § 1.51(c).
11703	(E) File a disclaimer in the USPTO dedicating to the public that portion of the term of the patent from January 24, 2025 to January 23, 2030.	1145	t	35. ANSWER: (E) is correct because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) states, in pertinent part, that “any patentee may disclaim or dedicate to the public...any terminal part of the term, of the patent granted.” 35 U.S.C. § 173 states, “Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.” (A) is wrong because such action would not permit Igor to financially exploit any portion of the term of his patent, since 37 CFR § 3.56 indicates that the result is a conditional assignment, which is regarded as an absolute assignment for Office purposes.

(C) is wrong because Igor would not achieve his objective of dedicating at least a portion of his patent term to the public, since the term of the design patent would expire on January 23, 2030. 35 U.S.C. § 173. (D) is wrong because 37 CFR § 1.321(a) restricts a disclaimer to “any complete claim or claims” or “the entire term, or any terminal part of the term” of a patent. “Royalties received from licensing" are not addressed by 37 CFR § 1.321(a).
11709	(A)Abandon the application since the Board affirmed the rejection of independent claim 1.	1147	t	37. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1214.06, under the heading “Examiner Sustained in Whole or in Part.” Under the heading “No Claims Stand Allowed” it states “Claims indicated as allowable prior to appeal except for their dependency from rejected claims will be treated as if they were rejected.” (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. These options would apply to applications where the Board reversed the rejection of the dependent claims and affirmed the rejection of the independent claim. (D) is not correct. The Board does not render a decision on objected to claims. See 37 CFR § 1.191(c). (E) is not correct because the mailing of a Board decision does not abandoned an application. See 37 CFR § 1.197(a).
11710	(B) Convert the dependent claims 7 to 10 into independent form by examiner’s amendment, cancel claims 1 to 6, and allow the application.	1147	f	37. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1214.06, under the heading “Examiner Sustained in Whole or in Part.” Under the heading “No Claims Stand Allowed” it states “Claims indicated as allowable prior to appeal except for their dependency from rejected claims will be treated as if they were rejected.” (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. These options would apply to applications where the Board reversed the rejection of the dependent claims and affirmed the rejection of the independent claim. (D) is not correct. The Board does not render a decision on objected to claims. See 37 CFR § 1.191(c). (E) is not correct because the mailing of a Board decision does not abandoned an application. See 37 CFR § 1.197(a).
11711	(C) Mail an Office action to applicant setting a 1-month time limit in which the applicant may rewrite dependent claims 7 to 10 in independent form. If no timely reply is received, the examiner should amend the objected to claims, 7 to 10, and allow the application.	1147	f	37. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1214.06, under the heading “Examiner Sustained in Whole or in Part.” Under the heading “No Claims Stand Allowed” it states “Claims indicated as allowable prior to appeal except for their dependency from rejected claims will be treated as if they were rejected.” (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers.

11712	(D) Mail an Office action to applicant with a new rejection of claims 7 to 10 based on the Board’s decision.	1147	f	37. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1214.06, under the heading “Examiner Sustained in Whole or in Part.” Under the heading “No Claims Stand Allowed” it states “Claims indicated as allowable prior to appeal except for their dependency from rejected claims will be treated as if they were rejected.” (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. These options would apply to applications where the Board reversed the rejection of the dependent claims and affirmed the rejection of the independent claim. (D) is not correct. The Board does not render a decision on objected to claims. See 37 CFR § 1.191(c). (E) is not correct because the mailing of a Board decision does not abandoned an application. See 37 CFR § 1.197(a).
11713	(E)No action should be taken by the examiner since the Board affirmed the rejection of independent claim 1, the application was abandoned on the date the Board decision was mailed.	1147	f	37. ANSWER: (A) is the most correct answer. MPEP § 1214.06, under the heading “Examiner Sustained in Whole or in Part.” Under the heading “No Claims Stand Allowed” it states “Claims indicated as allowable prior to appeal except for their dependency from rejected claims will be treated as if they were rejected.” (B) and (C) are not the most correct answers. These options would apply to applications where the Board reversed the rejection of the dependent claims and affirmed the rejection of the independent claim. (D) is not correct. The Board does not render a decision on objected to claims. See 37 CFR § 1.191(c). (E) is not correct because the mailing of a Board decision does not abandoned an application. See 37 CFR § 1.197(a).
11714	(A)Once the issue fee has become due, provided an original application has not been pending more than three years, the applicant may request and the Office may grant a request for deferral of payment of the issue fee.	1148	f	38. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As to (B), see MPEP §§ 2203 and 2212. As to (D), the claim for priority is not required, as a person may not wish to do so in order to increase the term of his or her patent. As to (A) deferral under 37 CFR § 1.103 is not available following the notice of allowance. Since (B) and (C) are correct, (E) is the best answer.
11715	(B) The time period set for the payment of the issue fee is statutory and cannot be extended. However, if payment is not timely made and the delay in making the payment is shown to be unavoidable, upon payment of a fee for delayed payment, it may be accepted as though no abandonment had occurred, but there will be a reduction on the patent term adjustment for the period of abandonment.	1148	f	38. ANSWER: (E) is the most correct answer. As to (B), see MPEP §§ 2203 and 2212. As to (D), the claim for priority is not required, as a person may not wish to do so in order to increase the term of his or her patent. As to (A) deferral under 37 CFR § 1.103 is not available following the notice of allowance. Since (B) and (C) are correct, (E) is the best answer.
11729	(A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are patentably distinguishable from the prior art.	1152	t	see MPEP 706.02(b)(1)
11724	(A)The Foreman reference is nonanalogous art, but the reference may be reasonably pertinent to Barry’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which Barry was concerned.	1151	f	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2143.03. To establish prima facie obviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art. (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 2141.01(a). Although an argument that the reference is nonanalogous art may be appropriate, it is overcome by the acknowledgment that the reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned. As discussed in MPEP § 2141.01(a), under the heading “To Rely On A Reference Under 35 U.S.C. 103, It Must Be Analogous Prior Art,” which quotes In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to rely on a reference as a basis for rejection of the applicant’s invention, “the reference must either be in the field of the applicant’s endeavor or, if not, be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned.” Here, the argument acknowledges that reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s problem solving endeavor. (C) is incorrect. U.S. patents may b used as of their filing dates to show that the claimed subject matter is anticipated or obvious. See MPEP § 2136.02 under the heading “The Supreme Court Has Authorized 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections Based On 35 USC 102(e).” (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 716.01(c), under the heading, “To Be Of Probative Value, Any Objective Evidence Should Be Supported By Actual Proof,” states “Objective evidence which must be factually supported by an appropriate affidavit or declaration to be of probative value includes evidence of unexpected results....” It also quotes from In re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699, 222 USPQ 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1984), “It is well settled that unexpected results must be established by factual evidence. Mere argument or conclusory statements in the specification does not suffice.” De Blauwe, 736 F.2d at 705, 222 USPQ at 196. Here, the conclusory statement in the specification does not suffice. (E) is incorrect. MPEP § 2145, subsection VIII (under the heading “Arguing About The Age Of References”), quotingfrom In re Wright, 569 F.2d 1124, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977), states “The mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.” Here, the mere fact that the Foreman patent issued 105 years before the filing date of the pending patent application is unpersuasive of the non-obviousness of the applicant’s claim
11725	(B) The rejection does not address a claimed limitation, and neither of the references teaches the claimed limitation.	1151	t	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2143.03. To establish prima facie obviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art. (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 2141.01(a). Although an argument that the reference is nonanalogous art may be appropriate, it is overcome by the acknowledgment that the reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s endeavor to solving the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned.

11727	(D) The original specification states that the results achieved by the claimed invention are unexpected. (The statement is unsubstantiated by evidence).	1151	f	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2143.03. To establish prima facie obviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art.

11730	(B) Filing an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 showing that the reference invention is not by “another.”	1152	f	see MPEP 706.02(b)(1)
11785	(B) In order to add matter not previously found in the patent, a continuation-in-part reissue application must be filed.	1166	f	6. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1411.01. As to (A) see MPEP § 1402. A reissue patent is not granted. As to (B), new matter may not be entered in a reissue. As to (D) see MPEP § 1412.03. Since (A), and (B) are incorrect, (E) is incorrect.
11800	(B) Inventor C cannot be excluded from access t the application because inventor B has not agreed to exclude inventor C. In order to exclude a co-inventor from access to an application, all the remaining inventors must agree to exclude that co-inventor.	1169	f	9. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 106.01
11728	(E)The Foreman patent issued 105 years before the filing date of the pending patent application.	1151	f	41. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2143.03. To establish prima facie obviousness of a claimed invention, all of the claimed limitations must be taught or suggested by the prior art. (A) is incorrect. See MPEP § 2141.01(a).

As discussed in MPEP § 2141.01(a), under the heading “To Rely On A Reference Under 35 U.S.C. 103, It Must Be Analogous Prior Art,” which quotes In re Oetiker, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1445 (Fed. Cir. 1992), to rely on a reference as a basis for rejection of the applicant’s invention, “the reference must either be in the field of the applicant’s endeavor or, if not, be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned.” Here, the argument acknowledges that reference may be reasonably pertinent to the applicant’s problem solving endeavor. (C) is incorrect. U.S. patents may b used as of their filing dates to show that the claimed subject matter is anticipated or obvious. See MPEP § 2136.02 under the heading “The Supreme Court Has Authorized 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejections Based On 35 USC 102(e).” (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 716.01(c), under the heading, “To Be Of Probative Value, Any Objective Evidence Should Be Supported By Actual Proof,” states “Objective evidence which must be factually supported by an appropriate affidavit or declaration to be of probative value includes evidence of unexpected results....” It also quotes from In re De Blauwe, 736 F.2d 699, 222 USPQ 191, 196 (Fed. Cir. 1984), “It is well settled that unexpected results must be established by factual evidence. Mere argument or conclusory statements in the specification does not suffice.” De Blauwe, 736 F.2d at 705, 222 USPQ at 196. Here, the conclusory statement in the specification does not suffice. (E) is incorrect. MPEP § 2145, subsection VIII (under the heading “Arguing About The Age Of References”), quoting from In re Wright, 569 F.2d 1124, 193 USPQ 332, 335 (CCPA 1977), states “The mere age of the references is not persuasive of the unobviousness of the combination of their teachings, absent evidence that, notwithstanding knowledge of the references, the art tried and failed to solve the problem.” Here, the mere fact that the Foreman patent issued 105 years before the filing date of the pending patent application is unpersuasive of the non-obviousness of the applicant’s claim

11739	(A)Indicate the claim allowable over the prior art because there is no teaching, motivation or suggestion to increase the amount of polypropylene from 34.9% to35% and decrease the amount of polyethylene from 65.1% to 65%.	1154	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties. See MPEP 2144.05 In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed. Cir. 1985), a claim recited a titanium base alloy consisting essentially of 0.8% nickel, 0.3% molybdenum, up to 0.1% maximum iron, and the balance titanium. A prior art reference described two similar alloys: (i) one with 0.25% molybdenum, 0.75% nickel, and balance titanium; and (ii) another with 0.31% molybdenum, 0.94% nickel, and balance titanium. The court held: As admitted by appellent’s affidavit evidence from James A. Hall, the Russian article discloses two alloys having compositions very close to that of claim 3, which is 0.3% Mo and 0.8% Ni, balance titanium. The two alloys in the prior art have 0.25% Mo-0.75% Ni and 0.31% Mo-0.94% Ni, respectively. The proportions are so close that prima facie one skilled in the art would have expected them to have the same properties. Appellee produced no evidence to rebut that prima facie case. The specific alloy of claim 3 must therefore be considered to have been obvious from known alloys. Id. Thus, (A) is incorrect. (B) See MPEP § 2131.03 section III and (D) are incorrect because a claim is anticipated by a prior art reference only when the prior art discloses, either expressly or inherently, every limitation of the claimed invention. (E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11740	(B) Reject the claim under 35 USC 102 as anticipated by the prior art reference.	1154	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties. See MPEP 2144.05 In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed.

(E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11741	(C) Reject the claim under 35 USC 103 as obvious over the prior art reference.	1154	t	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties. See MPEP 2144.05 In Titanium Metals Corp. v. Banner, 778 F.2d 775, 783, 227 USPQ 773, 779 (Fed.

(E) is incorrect because (C) is correct.
11742	(D)Reject the claim alternatively under 35 USC 102 as anticipated by or under 35 USC 103 as obvious over the prior art reference.	1154	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. A prima facie case of obviousness exists where the claimed ranges and the prior art are close enough that one of ordinary skill in the art would have expected them to have the same properties.

11756	(C) In a utility case, gross sales figures accompanied by evidence as to what sales would normally be expected in the market.	1158	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. Gross sales figures must be measured against a logical standard in order to determine whether or not there is commercial success. The recitations of accompanying evidence in (A), (B), and (C) are logical in that they provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (D), on the other hand, recites accompanying evidence which is illogical in that it does not provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (E) is wrong because it provides a logical basis for attributing commercial success to the design of the device, rather than the utilitarian function of the device. MPEP § 716.03(b).
11803	(E) An assignee filing an application can control access to an application and exclude inventors who have not assigned their rights and other assignees from inspecting the application.	1169	f	9. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 106.01
11743	(E)None of the above.	1154	f	44. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer.

The recitations of accompanying evidence in (A), (B), and (C) are logical in that they provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (D), on the other hand, recites accompanying evidence which is illogical in that it does not provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (E) is wrong because it provides a logical basis for attributing commercial success to the design of the device, rather than the utilitarian function of the device. MPEP § 716.03(b).
11755	(B) In a utility case, gross sales figures accompanied by evidence as to the time period during which the product was sold.	1158	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. Gross sales figures must be measured against a logical standard in order to determine whether or not there is commercial success. The recitations of accompanying evidence in (A), (B), and (C) are logical in that they provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (D), on the other hand, recites accompanying evidence which is illogical in that it does not provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (E) is wrong because it provides a logical basis for attributing commercial success to the design of the device, rather than the utilitarian function of the device. MPEP § 716.03(b).
11779	(A) Persuasively arguing that the claims are distinguishable from the cited prior art.	1165	t	see MPEP 706.02(b)
11787	(D)A dependent claim may be broadened in a reissue application only in the first two years of the enforceable life of the patent.	1166	f	6. ANSWER: (C) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 1411.01. As to (A) see MPEP § 1402. A reissue patent is not granted. As to (B), new matter may not be entered in a reissue. As to (D) see MPEP § 1412.03. Since (A), and (B) are incorrect, (E) is incorrect.
11758	(E)In a design case, evidence of commercial success clearly attributable to the design, and not to improved performance of the device.	1158	f	48. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. Gross sales figures must be measured against a logical standard in order to determine whether or not there is commercial success. The recitations of accompanying evidence in (A), (B), and (C) are logical in that they provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (D), on the other hand, recites accompanying evidence which is illogical in that it does not provide a comparative basis for determining commercial success. (E) is wrong because it provides a logical basis for attributing commercial success to the design of the device, rather than the utilitarian function of the device. MPEP § 716.03(b).

11764	(A) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing 66% by volume of gallium and 14% by volume of copper.	1160	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading“Open-Ended Numerical Ranges.” Paraphrasing the explanation therein, when an independent claim recites a composition comprising “at least 20% iron” and a dependent claim sets forth specific amounts of non-iron ingredients which add up to100%, apparently to the exclusion of iron, an ambiguity is created with regard to the “at least” limitation unless the percentages of the non-iron ingredients are based on the weight of the non-iron ingredients. On the other hand, a composition claimed to have a theoretical content greater than 100% (i.e., 20-80% of iron, 20-80% of gallium, and 1-25% of copper) is not necessarily indefinite simply because the claims may be read in theory to include compositions that are impossible in fact to formulate. Here, because the invention is a non-theoretical alloy, the sum of the claimed constituents cannot exceed 100% unless the percentage is based on weight. In (D), the sum of elements (B) and (C) is 81% by volume, leaving only 19% for iron. Claim 1, however, requires “at least 20% iron,” rendering Claim 2 ambiguous as to the percentage of element A. (A) is incorrect. The sum of gallium and copper components is 80%, leaving a possible 20% of the composition for element iron. Claim 1 requires “at least 20% iron,” which includes 20% iron. Therefore, the sum of iron, gallium and copper components in Claim 2 is 100%. (B) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron”includes 21% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 11% gallium, and “at least 10% copper includes 10.01% copper. (C) is incorrect. “At least 20% iron” includes 20% iron, “at least 10% gallium includes 10% gallium, and “at least 10% copper” includes 10% copper. (E) is incorrect because Claim 1 uses the open transition phrase “comprising,” which permits additional elements to be added to the composition. Nothing in the problem indicates that an additional component, silver, cannot be added to the composition.
11765	(B) Claim 2: The alloy of claim 1 containing at least 21% by volume of iron, 11% by volume of gallium, and 10.01% by volume of copper.	1160	f	50. ANSWER: (D) is the most correct answer.

11774	(A)Claim 1. A composition comprising: equal amounts by weight of A, B, and C, and an effective amount of D to reduce the acidity of the composition.	1162	f	2.ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. 35 U.S.C. § 112, second paragraph, and MPEP § 2173.05(c), under the heading “III. Effective Amount.” The claim presented in (B) is improper as “an effective amount” has been held to be indefinite when the claim fails to state the function that is to be achieved and more than one effect can be implied from the specification. In re Fredericksen 213 F.2d 547, 102 USPQ 35 (CCPA 1954). It is unclear whether “an effective amount” in (B) is an effective amount to reduce acidity or an effective amount to reduce moisture. The claims presented in (A) and (C) find support in the disclosure, which provides guidelines for determining “an effective amount” for each of the claims in (A) and (C). See MPEP § 2173.05(c) under the heading “III. Effective Amount.” The claim presented in (D) is not indefinite, given that A, B, and C are known materials as set forth in the question and the composition can be determined by the claim language. (E) is incorrect because (B) is correct.

11844	(A) Jane calls the examiner for an interview after submitting an appeal brief in response to the examiner issuing a final office action.	1180	f	20. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 713.01. An interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application. (A) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.05. Section 713.02 states that although “Except in unusual situations, interviews with examiners are not permitted after the submission of an appeal brief or after a notice of allowability for the application has been mailed.” (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.03. Larry is only sounding out the examiner and has no authority to commit Joe to any agreement reached with the examiner. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.09. Jane has no right to an interview following the final rejection. Although such an interview may be granted if the examiner is convinced that disposal or clarification for appeal may be accomplished with only nominal further consideration, interviews merely to restate arguments of record or to discuss new limitations which would require more than nominal reconsideration or new search should be denied. (E) is incorrect because D is incorrect.
11845	(B)After receiving the first Office action Jane calls the examiner for an interview for the purpose of clarifying the structure and operation of the invention as claimed and disclosed, because the examiner’s analysis regarding patentability in the rejection is novel and suggests that the examiner is interpreting the claimed invention in a manner very different from the inventor’s intent.	1180	t	20. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 713.01. An interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application. (A) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.05. Section 713.02 states that although “Except in unusual situations, interviews with examiners are not permitted after the submission of an appeal brief or after a notice of allowability for the application has been mailed.” (C) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.03. Larry is only sounding out the examiner and has no authority to commit Joe to any agreement reached with the examiner. (D) is incorrect. MPEP § 713.09. Jane has no right to an interview following the final rejection. Although such an interview may be granted if the examiner is convinced that disposal or clarification for appeal may be accomplished with only nominal further consideration, interviews merely to restate arguments of record or to discuss new limitations which would require more than nominal reconsideration or new search should be denied. (E) is incorrect because D is incorrect.
11846	(C) Jane has Larry, a registered practitioner in the Washington D.C. area, who is more familiar with interview practice to call the examiner. Jane gives Larry a copy of the first Office action, which suggests that the primary examiner’s analysis is incorrect, and offers to explain why. Jane instructs Larry that because Larry is unfamiliar with the inventor, Larry should not agree to possible ways in which the claims could be modified, or at least indicate to the examiner that Jane would have to approve of any such agreement.	1180	f	20. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 713.01. An interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.

(E) is incorrect because D is incorrect.
11847	(D)Jane calls the primary examiner after receiving the final rejection, demanding that the examiner withdraw the finality of the final action. When the examiner states that the final rejection is proper, Jane demands an interview as a matter of right to explain the arguments.	1180	f	20. ANSWER: (B) is the most correct answer. See MPEP § 713.01. An interview should be had only when the nature of the case is such that the interview could serve to develop and clarify specific issues and lead to a mutual understanding between the examiner and the applicant, and thereby advance the prosecution of the application.

(E) is incorrect because D is incorrect.
11851	(C) The petition is supported by applicant’s statement that there is an infringing device actually on the market, that a rigid comparison of the alleged infringing device with the claims of the application has been made, and that applicant has made a careful and thorough search of the prior art.	1181	f	see MPEP 708.02

884	26.  Co-inventors  Smith  and  Jones  filed  an  application  for  a  patent  on  a  cell  phone,  on  May 15, 2002.  They received a first Office action from a primary examiner rejecting the claims under  35  USC  102(a)  over  a  publication  by  Bell  and  Watson,  published  on  April  5,  2002,describing  a  cell  phone  having  all  the  same  features  as  is  claimed  in  the  patent  application.    In  reply,  the  co-inventors  each  submitted  a  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.131  stating  that  they  hadactually  reduced  the  invention  to  practice  no  later  than  March  13,  2002.    However,  thedeclarations  failed  to  include  two  claimed  features.    Neither  the  particular  antenna  needed  to  enable the cell phone could receive transmissions from the local cellular transmitting tower, nor a detachable carrying strap was included in the declarations.  As evidence of their prior reduction to  practice,  Smith  and  Jones  submitted  their  co-authored  journal  article.    The  journal  article  contained  a  figure  of  the  cell  phone  as  described  in  the  declarations.    That  is,  the  cell  phoneshown  in  the  figure  of  the  article  lacked  an  antenna  and  a  detachable  strap.    The  article  was  received  by  the  journal  on  March  13,  2002,  and  was  published  on  April  30,  2002.    The  cell  phones shown in the figure in the Bell and Watson publication, and in the Smith and Jones patent application have the particular antenna and a detachable strap.  Which of the following actions, if taken  by  the  examiner,  would  be  the  most  proper  in  accordance  with  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures set forth in the MPEP?	4
885	27.  On  January  2,  2001,  a  registered  practitioner  filed  a  patent  application  with  the  USPTO  for inventor Bock.  The application includes a specification and a single claim to the invention,which reads as follows: 1.  A new string consisting only of material Z that has the ability to stretch to beyond itsinitial unstretched length.On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary examiner rejecting the claim.  The claim is solely rejected under 35 USC 102 in view of Patent A, which discloses astring  consisting  only  of  material  Z.    The  Office  action  states,  “Patent  A  discloses  a  string  consisting only of material Z.  Patent A does not expressly teach the stretchability property of thestring.  Nevertheless, the recited stretchability is inherent in the string of patent A.  Accordingly, patent A anticipates the claimed string.”  Mr. Bock believes he is entitled to a patent to his new string  and  authorizes  the  practitioner  to  reply  to  the  Office  action  by  arguing  that  his  string  stretches to ten times its initial unstretched length, something that patent A does not teach.  Since this  is  not  expressly  taught  in  Patent  A,  the  practitioner  argues,  Patent  A  cannot  anticipate  the  claimed  string.    In  accordance  with  USPTO  rules  and  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  is  the  practitioner’s reply persuasive as to error in the rejection?	4
886	28.  Ben  hires  a  registered  practitioner  to  prosecute  his  patent  application.    The  practitionerdrafted an application having fifteen claims.  Claim 1 is independent, and each of claims 2-15 are singularly  dependent  upon  claim  1.    A  proper  non-final  Office  action  is  mailed  to  thepractitioner.  Following consultation with Ben, the practitioner timely prepared, signed, and fileda reply to the Office action containing an amendment that does not add new matter, but does add claims  16-27.    Each  of  claims  16-27  is  directed  to  the  same  invention  sought  to  be  patented  through claims 1-15.  The dependency of each of claims 16-27 reads “any of claims 5-15.”  For purposes of fee calculation in accordance with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the  MPEP,  how  many  total  claims  are  contained  in  the  application  after  the  amendment  is  entered?	4
887	29.  In  accordance  with  USPTO  rules  and  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  which  of  thefollowing  statements  regarding  operability  or  enablement  of  a  prior  art  reference  is  the  most  correct? 	4

The  application  includes  a  specification  and  a  single  claim  to  the  inventionwhich reads as follows: 1.  Compound Y. In  the  specification,  Bloc  explains  that  compound  Y  is  an  intermediate  in  the  chemical  manufacture of synthetic Z.  With respect to synthetic Z, the specification discloses its structural formula and further states that synthetic Z is modeled on the natural form of Z to give it the sametherapeutic ability to alleviate pain.  The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a cure  for  cancer.    On  June  2,  2001,  the  practitioner  received  an  Office  action  from  the  primary  examiner rejecting the claim.  The claim is rejected under 35 USC 101 as being inoperative; that is,  the  synthetic  Z  does  not  operate  to  produce  a  cure  for  cancer  (i.e.,  incredible  utility).    Bloc  believes  he  is  entitled  to  a  patent  to  his  compound  Y.    In  accordance  with  USPTO  rules  and  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  how  best  should  the  practitioner  reply  to  the  rejection  of  the  claim?	4
891	33.  Application  No.  A  was  published  as  U.S.  Patent  Application  Publication  No.  B.    Amember  of  the  public  reviewed  the  listing  of  the  file  contents  of  the  application  on  the  Patent  Application Information Retrieval system and determined that the application was still pending, that  a  final  Office  action  was  mailed,  and  that  the  application  file  is  in  the  Technology  Centerwhere  it  is  being  examined.    The  member  of  the  public  does  not  have  a  power  to  inspect,  butwould like a copy of the final Office action as well as the other papers in the patent application. In  accordance  with  the  USPTO  rules  and  the  procedures  set  forth  in  the  MPEP,  can  a  copy  of  these papers be obtained by the member of the public, and if so, how can the copy be obtained? 	4
892	34. A first Office action on the merits rejecting Claim 1 under 35 USC 103 as being obvious in  view  of  reference  A  set  a  three  month  shortened  statutory  period  for  reply.    A  registered  practitioner  files  a  timely  response  (without  an  extension  of  time)  to  the  first  Office  action  amending  Claim  1  to  include  a  limitation  not  found  in  reference  A  or  any  other  prior  art  of  record.    However,  the  limitation  also  lacks  support  in  applicant’s  original  disclosure,  i.e.,  it  is  new matter.  Which of the following courses of action, if taken by the primary examiner, would be in accord with the USPTO rules and the procedures set forth in the MPEP?	4

The specification goes on to state that synthetic Z is also a\ncure for cancer. On June 2, 2001, the practitioner received an Office action from the primary\nexaminer rejecting the claim. The claim is rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 as being inoperative;\nthat is, the synthetic Z does not operate to produce a cure for cancer (i.e., incredible utility).\nBloc believes he is entitled to a patent to his compound Y. In accordance with the patent laws,\nrules and procedures as related in the MPEP, how best should the practitioner reply to the\nrejection of the claim?	5

920	12. Inventors B and C are employed by Corporation D, which authorized registered\npractitioner E to prepare and file a patent application claiming subject matter invented by B and\nC. Inventor B signed the oath, an assignment to Corporation D, and a power of attorney\nauthorizing practitioner E to prosecute the application. Inventor C refused to sign the oath and\nany assignment documents for the application. The employment contract between inventor C\nand Corporation D contains no language obligating C to assign any invention to Corporation D.\nA patent application was properly filed in the USPTO under 37 CFR 1.47 naming B and C as\ninventors, but without inventor C signing the oath. C has now started his own company\ncompeting with Corporation D producing a product with the invention in the application.\nInventor B is a friend of inventor C and wants C to have continued access to the application.\nWhich of the following statements is in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as\nrelated in the MPEP?	5
921	13. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which\nof the following fees may not be reduced by 50 percent for “small entities”?	5
922	14. The specification of a patent application contains limited disclosure of using antisense\ntechnology in regulating three particular genes in E. coli cells. The specification contains three\nexamples, each applying antisense technology to regulating one of the three particular genes in\nE. coli cells. Despite the limited disclosure, the specification states that the “the practices of this\ninvention are generally applicable with respect to any organism containing genetic material\ncapable of being expressed such as bacteria, yeast, and other cellular organisms.” All of the\noriginal claims in the application are broadly directed to the application of antisense technology\nto any cell. No claim is directed to applying antisense technology to regulating any of the three\nparticular genes in E. coli cells. The claims are rejected under 35 USC 112, first paragraph, for\nlack of enablement. In support of the rejection, a publication is cited that correctly notes\nantisense technology is highly unpredictable, requiring experimentation to ascertain whether the\ntechnology works in each type of cell. The publication cites the inventor’s own articles\n(published after the application was filed) that include examples of the inventor’s own failures to\ncontrol the expressions of other genes in E. coli and other types of cells. In accordance with the\npatent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, the rejection is:	5

924	16. Tribell files a patent application for her aroma therapy kit on November 29, 1999, which\nissues as a patent on August 7, 2001. She tries to market her kit but all of her prospects are\nconcerned that her patent claims are not sufficiently broad. On September 5, 2001, Tribell asks a\nregistered practitioner for advice on what to do to improve her ability to market her aroma\ntherapy kit. At the consultation the practitioner learns that in the original patent application,\nTribell had a number of claims which were subjected to a restriction requirement, but were\nnonelected and withdrawn from further consideration. The practitioner also determines that the\nclaims in the patent obtained by Tribell were narrower than the broader invention disclosed in\nthe specification, and the cited references may not preclude patentability of the broader\ninvention. Which of the following is the best course of action to pursue in accordance with the\npatent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP?	5
925	17. Inventor files an application containing the following original Claim 1:\n1. A widget comprising element A, and element B.\nIn a first Office action on the merits, a primary examiner rejects claim 1 under 35 USC 103 as\nbeing obvious over reference X. Reference X explicitly discloses a widget having element A,\nbut it does not disclose element B. The examiner, however, takes official notice of the fact that\nelement B is commonly associated with element A in the art and on that basis concludes that it\nwould have been obvious to provide element B in the reference X widget. In reply to the Office\naction, the registered practitioner representing the applicant makes no amendments, but instead\nrequests reconsideration of the rejection by demanding that examiner show proof that element B\nis commonly associated with element A in the art. Which of the following actions, if taken by\nthe examiner in the next Office action would be in accord with the patent laws, rules and\nprocedures as related in the MPEP?\nI. Vacate the rejection and allow the claim.\nII. Cite a reference that teaches element B is commonly associated with element A in the art\nand make the rejection final.\nIII. Deny entry of applicant’s request for reconsideration on the ground that it is not\nresponsive to the rejection and allow applicant time to submit a responsive amendment.	5

928	20. On January 3, 2003, a registered practitioner filed a continuation application that includes\na benefit claim to a prior-filed application. The practitioner simultaneously filed in the priorfiled\napplication an express abandonment in favor of a continuing application. The prior\napplication contained five drawing figures described in the specification. However, the\ncontinuation application contains only four of the five drawing figures. The specification of the\ncontinuation application did not include a complete description of the missing drawing figure. A\npostcard from the USPTO, listing the contents of the continuation application, contains a note\nthat only four drawing figures were received. The practitioner inadvertently omitted one of the\ndrawing figures mentioned in the specification when he filed the continuation application. The\nmissing drawing figure shows a claimed feature of the invention. On February 10, 2003, the\npractitioner received a Notice of Omitted Item(s) properly according a filing date of January 3,\n2003 for the continuation application without the missing drawing figure and notifying the\napplicant that the drawing is missing. Which of the following procedures for filing the missing\ndrawing would comply with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP for\naccording the continuation application a January 3, 2003 filing date with the five drawing figures\nthat were present in the application?	5
929	21. Patent application A was filed on January 12, 1995, containing claims 1-10. A primary\nexaminer rejects the claims under 35 USC 102(b) as being anticipated by a U.S. patent issued on\nJune 2, 1992. The rejection also relies on a technical paper published March 12, 1993 to show\nthat a characteristic is inherent in the patent, although not expressed in its disclosure. According\nto the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following actions is\nmost likely to overcome the rejection?	5
930	22. Application Number A was published as U.S. Patent Application Publication Number B.\nA member of the public reviewed the listing of the file contents of the application on the Patent\nApplication Information Retrieval system and determined that the application was still pending,\nthat a final Office action was mailed, and that the application file is in the Technology Center\nwhere it is being examined. The member of the public does not have a power to inspect, but\nwould like a copy of the final Office action as well as the other papers in the patent application.\nIn accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, can a copy of\nthese papers be obtained by the member of the public, and if so, how can the copy be obtained?	5
931	23. Applicant files a claim which includes the following limitation: “a step for crossing the\nroad.” The specification recites the following acts: “(1) go to the curb, (2) look both ways, (3) if\nthe road appears safe, walk across the road, (4) step up onto the far curb, (5) continue walking.”\nThe primary examiner properly construes the step limitation to cover the foregoing acts. A prior\nart reference, published two years before the application was filed, expressly describes acts\n(1)-(4), but not (5). This same reference also discloses the remaining limitations recited in\napplicant’s claim, i.e., those other than the step plus function limitation. The examiner rejects\nthe claim under 35 USC 102(b) as being anticipated by the prior art reference. In accordance\nwith the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following is the\nmost complete reply to overcome the rejection under these circumstances?	5
932	24. A registered practitioner filed an application for an applicant claiming a “a means for\npulling the door open.” The specification describes a handle and a knob as being used together\nas a corresponding structure for pulling the door open. A prior art patent discloses a door opened\nby pulling on an attached bar. The primary examiner issued an Office action rejecting the claim\nunder 35 USC 102 as being anticipated. In the action, the examiner properly identified the\ncorresponding structure described in applicant’s specification as the means for pulling the door\nopen, and properly explained why the prior art attached bar is the equivalent of the structure\ndescribed in applicant’s specification. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures\nas related in the MPEP, which of the following is the most correct reply to overcome the\nrejection under these circumstances?	5
933	25. A registered practitioner filed a utility patent application on May 15, 2000 pursuant to 35\nUSC 111(a) claiming a detergent composition. On May 15, 2002 the Office mailed a non-final\nOffice action setting a 3-month period for reply. A proper reply was mailed on August 15, 2002\nby first-class mail with sufficient postage to the USPTO. The reply was received by the USPTO\non September 15, 2002. On September 30, 2002, the Office mailed a final Office action. On\nOctober 15, 2002, the Office received a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) meeting all\nof the requirements of 37 CFR 1.114. On October 30, 2002, the USPTO mailed a Notice of\nAllowance in view of the RCE and amendment. The utility application issued on February 11,\n2003. Which of the following statements is in accord with the patent laws, rules and procedures\nas related in the MPEP concerning the amount of additional term applicant X would receive\nbecause of Patent Term Adjustment (PTA)?	5
934	26. When, in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP,\nis a supplemental oath or declaration treated as an amendment under 37 CFR 1.312?	5

936	28. A registered practitioner files a patent application with the following claim:\n1. A plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising circular receptacles to\nreceive wine bottles and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even while the\nshopping cart is moved about a store so that they do not fall and break.\nPatent A discloses a plastic insert for the bottom of a shopping cart comprising rectangular\nreceptacles to receive cereal boxes and to maintain them in an upright and stable position even\nwhile the shopping cart is moved about a store in order to keep them organized in the cart. Patent\nA also discloses that the receptacles could be any circular diameter to receive complementary\nshaped bottles or jars such as to securely hold 2-liter soft drink bottles or mayonnaise jars. A\nprimary examiner rejected the claim as being obvious under 35 USC 103 over Patent A\nreasoning that Patent A suggests to one of ordinary skill in the art an insert for a shopping cart\nwith circular receptacles for the purpose of stably maintaining any bottle, including wine bottles,\nwhile pushing the cart about a store so that the cart remains organized. Assume the examiner has\nmade a sufficient prima facie case of obviousness. Following receipt of the rejection, the\npractitioner filed a timely reply. The practitioner argued that Patent A does not render obvious\nthe claimed subject matter because there is no suggestion of a plastic insert to keep a wine bottle\nfrom falling and breaking in a shopping cart. Which of the following best explains why, in\naccordance with the patent laws, rules and the procedures as related in the MPEP, the examiner\nshould or should not be persuaded by the practitioner’s argument?	5
937	29. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which\nof the following statements regarding publications as references is incorrect?	5
938	30. A registered practitioner receives an Office action for Application X, a patent application\nfiled after November 29, 1999. The action contains a rejection of all the claims as being obvious\nunder 35 USC 103(a) over Patent A in view of Patent B. Patent A is only available as prior art\nunder 35 USC 102(e). Patent B is available under 35 USC 102(b). The practitioner seeks to\ndisqualify Patent A as prior art under 35 USC 103(c). Which of the following would be\nsufficient evidence to disqualify Patent A as prior art in accordance with the patent laws, rules\nand procedures as related in the MPEP?	5
939	31. Reexamination has been ordered following receipt of a request for reexamination of U.S.\nPatent X, filed by the patentee. Patent X contains independent claims 1 through 4, each directed\nto a hydrocyclone separator apparatus. They are the only claims that were ever presented during\nprosecution of the application that matured into Patent X. In the first Office action during\nreexamination, claims 1 through 4 are rejected as being obvious under 35 USC 103 over U.S.\nPatent Z. The apparatus is used for separating material, including fibers suspended in a liquid\nsuspension, into a light fraction containing the fibers, and a heavy fraction containing rejects.\nAssume there are no issues under 35 USC 102, 103, or 112, and that any dependent claim is\nproperly dependent. Recommend which of the following claims, if any, would be subject to\nrejection under 35 USC 305 for improperly enlarging the scope of the original claim in\naccordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP.	5

942	34. A registered practitioner filed a utility application on February 11, 2002. On April 4,\n2002, the practitioner filed an information disclosure statement (IDS) in the application. The\npractitioner received a notice of allowance dated January 3, 2003 soon after it was mailed. When\ndiscussing the application with the practitioner on January 21, 2003, and before paying the issue\nfee, the client notices for the first time that a reference, which is one of many patents obtained by\nthe client’s competitor, was inadvertently omitted from the IDS. The client has been aware of\nthis reference since before the application was filed. The client is anxious to have this reference\nappear on the face of the patent as having been considered by the USPTO. Which of the\nfollowing actions, if taken by the practitioner, would not be in accord with the patent law, rules\nand procedures as related by the MPEP?	5
943	35. A registered practitioner files an amendment to the client’s claim which inserts language\ninto the claim. The primary examiner improperly rejects the claim under 35 USC 112, first\nparagraph, description requirement. The examiner’s rejection states that the amendment inserted\nnew matter which does not have descriptive support in the original specification. The examiner\ncorrectly points out that there is no literal support for the amendatory claim language in the\noriginal specification, but erroneously concludes that it constitutes new matter. Assume that\nthere is support for the amendment in the original disclosure. In accordance with the patent laws,\nrules and procedures as related in the MPEP, a proper reply would include which of the\nfollowing argument(s) to show the examiner is in error?	5
944	36. A registered practitioner filed a patent application in the Office in 1999. Following\nexamination and a final rejection, the practitioner timely filed a proper notice of appeal and a\nproper appeal brief in the application wherein claims 1-3 stand rejected, claims 4 and 5, which\ndepend from claim 1, stand objected to as depending from a rejected claim but are otherwise\nallowable, and claims 6-10 stand allowed. The appeal involves claims 1-3. After the brief was\nfiled but prior to a decision by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences, the practitioner\nfiled a request for continued examination (RCE) with a submission in accordance with 37\nCFR 1.114 without paying the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(e). In accordance with the patent\nlaws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, what effect does the filing of the RCE\nwithout the fee set forth in Rule 1.17(e) have on the application under appeal?	5
945	37. Applicant filed an application containing a claim directed to a polishing wheel coated\nwith diamond grit particles. The application discloses, but does not claim, a diamond grit\nparticle size of 5-7 microns. The examiner rejected the claim under 35 USC 102(b) as being\nanticipated by a U.S. patent which disclosed as its invention a polishing wheel in accordance\nwith the claim of the application but coated with glass grit particles instead of diamond grit\nparticles. The applied patent, which issued more than 1 year prior to the effective filing date of\nthe application, also disclosed that diamond grit particles were known for coating on polishing\nwheels but were inferior to glass grit particles because they were more expensive and did not\nadhere as well to the polishing wheel. The applied patent disclosed a grit particle size of 50-100\nmicrons. Which of the following timely taken courses of action would comply with the patent\nlaws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP for overcoming the rejection?	5
946	38. Prosecution before the primary examiner results in the rejection of claim 1. Claim 2 was\nobjected to as being allowable except for its dependency from claim 1.

Appellant has filed no\nresponse to the decision of the Board, the appellant has taken no action, and the time for filing an\nappeal to the court or a civil action has expired. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and\nprocedures as related in the MPEP, which of the following actions is the most appropriate\nresponse by the examiner?	5
947	39. On May 1, 2001, a complete patent application was filed with the USPTO naming H as\nthe sole inventor. A primary examiner rejected all the claims in the application under 35\nUSC 102(e) as being anticipated by a U.S. Patent granted to inventors H and S. The patent was\ngranted on September 25, 2001 on an application filed on December 7, 2000. The claims of the\npatent application and U.S. patent define the same patentable invention as defined in 37\nCFR 1.601(n). The U.S. patent and the application have common ownership. Which of the\nfollowing, if properly submitted by applicant, would overcome the rejection in accordance with\nthe patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP?	5
948	40. In accordance with patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, which of\nthe following transitional phrases exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps from\nthe scope of a claim?	5

950	42. A registered practitioner filed a first patent application wherein claims 1-10 claims are\ndirected to a widget and claims 11-20 are directed to a method of making a widget. Following a\nproper restriction requirement, claims 1-10 were elected for prosecution. The primary examiner\nrejected claims 1-10. The practitioner filed a reply that only consisted of argument. The\nexaminer was unpersuaded by the argument, and entered a final rejection of claims 1-10. In\nreply, the practitioner filed a continuing application containing claims 1-10 directed to a widget,\nand claims 11-20 directed to a method of using a widget. In the continuing application, the\nexaminer enters a new written restriction requirement requiring a provisional election between\nclaims 1-10 and claims 11-20. The practitioner believes the new restriction requirement is\nimproper and would like the rejection in the parent application reviewed as well. The new\nrestriction requirement has not been made final. Which of the following best describes whether\nand why, in accordance with the patent laws, rules, and procedures as related by the MPEP, the\nreply to the restriction requirement may be by appeal to the Board of Patent Appeals and\nInterferences?	5
951	43. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, where\nthe independent claim in an application is to an article of manufacture, then a dependent claim to\nthe article of manufacture does not comply with 35 USC 112, fourth paragraph, if:	5

956	48. Buddy is a recent father and a machinist at a local machine shop. One day while driving\nto work, Buddy conceived an idea for an improved baby stroller. He quickly worked out many\nof the details of how to build such an improved stroller, but he still had questions. Buddy later\nexplained his idea to his employer and showed the employer detailed preliminary drawings of the\nstroller without any agreement as to confidentiality. Buddy wanted use of his employer’s\nmachine shop to build a model. Buddy’s employer was also excited about the stroller idea and\nits commercial potential, and the two quickly reached an oral agreement. Buddy would have free\nuse of the machine shop equipment and supplies after regular business hours to work on his\nmodel. In exchange, Buddy agreed to assign any patent rights in his invention to the employer\nfor $1,000.00. Only Buddy and, occasionally, his employer were ever present in the shop when\nBuddy was working on the stroller. Buddy finalized the design just over a year later, and a\nnonprovisional patent application was on file within a month of finalization along with a recently\nexecuted written assignment of the rights in the invention to Buddy’s employer. During\nprosecution of the patent application, the examiner learned of the oral agreement between Buddy\nand his employer, and rejected the claims on the basis that the invention was on sale more than\none year before the application filing date. Determine which of the following would provide the\nmost reasonable basis for traversing the rejection in accordance with the patent laws, rules and\nprocedures as related in the MPEP.	5
957	49. Inventor files an application for a non-theoretical metal alloy. The application as\noriginally filed contains the following Claim 1:\n1.

Claim 1 is independent, and each of claims 2-15 are\nsingularly dependent upon claim 1. A proper non-final Office action is mailed to the\npractitioner. Following consultation with Ben, the practitioner timely prepared, signed, and filed\na reply to the Office action containing an amendment that does not add new matter, but does add\nclaims 16-27. Each of claims 16-27 is directed to the same invention sought to be patented\nthrough claims 1-15. The dependency of each of claims 16-27 reads “any of claims 5-15.” For\npurposes of fee calculation in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in\nthe MPEP, how many total claims are contained in the application after the amendment is\nentered?	5
959	1.  In  accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP,  for  a  nonprovisional application to receive a filing date in the USPTO under 37 CFR 1.53(b), all of the following must be filed except:	6
960	2. A U.S. patent was granted on May 8, 2001.  The sole independent claim in the patent is directed  to  a  combination  of  elements  ABCD.    A  registered  practitioner  filed  a  reissue  application on April 11, 2003 to narrow sole independent claim.  In the reissue application, the independent claim is amended to a combination to elements ABCDE.  The reissue application is accompanied by a transmittal letter stating that the application was filed to narrow a claim, that all  inventors  could  not  be  located  to  sign  the  reissue  oath  or  declaration  at  that  time,  and  that  a  declaration would be submitted in due course.  No other amendments to the claims were filed on April 11, 2003.  On May 8, 2003, a declaration signed by all inventors is filed declaring that they had claimed less than they had a right to claim, and that the error arose without deceptive intent.  The inventors also filed on May 8, 2003 a preliminary amendment deleting element A from the sole independent claim leaving elements BCDE.  The amendment and declaration are filed using the  provisions  of  37  CFR  1.10.    The  practitioner  included  an  authorization  to  charge  the  practitioner’s  deposit  account  for  any  necessary  fees.

961	3.  An  applicant  submits  a  product-by-process  claim  to  a  shoe  made  by  a  series  of  specific  process steps.  The claim is rejected over a publication under 35 USC 102(b) and 103.  Assume for this question that the publication reasonably appears to show the identical shoe, but describes a  different  method  of  making  the  shoe.    What  is  the  proper  procedure  to  try  to  overcome  the  rejection in accordance with the patent laws, rules and the procedures as related in the MPEP?	6
996	38.  A  registered  practitioner  properly  recorded  an  assignment  document  for  application  A  identifying  XYZ  Company  as  the  assignee.    The  document  assigns  to  XYZ  Company  the  “subject  matter  claimed  in  Application  A.”    A  proper  restriction  requirement  was  made  by  a  primary examiner in application A between two distinct inventions, and the practitioner elected to prosecute one of the inventions.  Application A was prosecuted, and later became abandoned.  Before the abandonment date of application A, the practitioner filed a complete application B as a proper divisional application of application A.  Application B claimed the nonelected invention of Application A, and was published as a U.S. application publication.  XYZ Company remains the assignee of application A.  What must the practitioner do in accordance with the patent laws, rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP  to  ensure  that  XYZ  Company  is  listed  as  the  assignee on the face of any patent issuing from application B? 	6
962	4.  A  registered  practitioner  files  an  international  application  submission  that  includes  a  description, claims and drawings in the United States Receiving Office (RO/US) on Wednesday, January  8,  2003.    The  submission  did  not  include  the  required  request,  international  and  search  fees, or the designation of a PCT contracting State.  The RO/US mails an “Invitation to Correct the  Purported  International  Application,”  dated  January  10,  2003,  to  the  practitioner  indicating  that  the  designation  of  at  least  one  Contracting  State,  as  required  by  PCT  Article  11(1)(iii)(b),  was  not  included.    A  one-month  period  for  response  is  set  in  the  Invitation.    On  Monday,  February 10, 2003, the practitioner submits by facsimile a designation sheet of the Request Form designating  every  available  Contracting  State,  and  authorization  to  charge  all  required  fees.    In  accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP,  will  the  application be accorded an international filing date? 	6

964	6.  Inventor  Tip,  a  scientist  in  a  pencil  research  laboratory,  theorized  that,  based  on  the  abrasive  properties  of  moon  dust,  a  highly  efficient  erasure  can  be  made  by  adding  a  trace  amount  of  moon  dust  to  a  normal  pencil  erasure  formulation.    Point,  in  the  Sales  department,  determined that this would be perfect for a high end product.  A U.S. patent application has been filed  claiming  a  pencil  erasure  formulation  with  a  trace  amount  of  moon  dust.    An  example  of  how  to  make  the  formulation  with  specified  percentages  of  moon  dust  is  presented  therein.    Thereafter, Tip learns about the duty to disclose information and he recalls signing a declaration under 37 CFR 1.63 stating that he had reviewed and understood the contents of the specification including  the  claims.    Tip  becomes  concerned  that  the  use  of  moon  dust  was  only  a  theory  and  that to obtain patent would mislead the public to conclude that moon dust was actually used and found to be effective.  The application has been allowed, but the issue fee has not yet been paid.  Which of the following is most in accord with patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP?	6
965	7.  The  claimed  invention  in  a  patent  application  is  directed  to  an  explosive  composition  “comprising  60-90%  solid  ammonium  nitrate,  and  10-40%  water-in-oil  in  which  sufficient  aeration  is  entrapped  to  enhance  sensitivity  to  a  substantial  degree.”    The  application  discloses  that  the  explosive  requires  both  fuel  (the  ammonium  nitrate),  and  oxygen  to  “sensitize  the  composition.”    A  prior  art  reference,  published  more  than  two  years  before  the  effective  filing  date  of  the  application,  discloses  explosive  compositions  containing  water-in-oil  emulsions  having   identical   ingredients   to   those   claimed,   in   ranges   overlapping   with   the   claimed   composition.    The  only  element  of  the  claim  not  recited  in  the  reference  is  “sufficient  aeration  entrapped to enhance sensitivity to a substantial degree.”  The reference does not recognize that sufficient  aeration  sensitizes  the  fuel  to  a  substantial  degree.    In  addition  to  the  prior  art  reference,  a  printed  publication  contains  test  data  demonstrating  that  “sufficient  aeration”  is  necessarily an inherent element in the prior art blasting composition under the circumstances.  In accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  the  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP,  the  prior  art  reference: 	6

988	30.  Co-inventors  Smith  and  Jones  filed  an  application  for  a  patent  on  a  cell  phone,  on  May 15, 2002.  They received a first Office action from a primary examiner rejecting the claims under  35  USC  102(a)  over  a  publication  by  Bell  and  Watson,  published  on  April  5,  2002,  describing  a  cell  phone  having  all  the  same  features  as  is  claimed  in  the  patent  application.    In  reply,  the  co-inventors  each  submitted  a  declaration  under  37  CFR  1.131  stating  that  they  had  actually  reduced  the  invention  to  practice  no  later  than  March  13,  2002.    However,  the  declarations  failed  to  include  two  claimed  features.    Neither  the  particular  antenna  needed  to  enable the cell phone could receive transmissions from the local cellular transmitting tower, nor a detachable carrying strap was included in the declarations.  As evidence of their prior reduction to  practice,  Smith  and  Jones  submitted  their  co-authored  journal  article.    The  journal  article  contained  a  figure  of  the  cell  phone  as  described  in  the  declarations.    That  is,  the  cell  phone  shown  in  the  figure  of  the  article  lacked  an  antenna  and  a  detachable  strap.    The  article  was  received  by  the  journal  on  March  13,  2002,  and  was  published  on  April  30,  2002.    The  cell  phones shown in the figure in the Bell and Watson publication, and in the Smith and Jones patent application have the particular antenna and a detachable strap.  Which of the following actions, if taken  by  the  examiner,  would  be  the  most  proper  in  accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  the procedures as related in the MPEP?	6
989	31.  In  accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and  procedures  as  related  in  the  MPEP,  for  a  nonprovisional application to receive a filing date in the USPTO under 37 CFR 1.53(b), all of the following must be filed except:	6
990	32.  Determine  which  of  the  following  documents,  if  any,  must  also  contain  a  separate  verification statement in accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP. 	6
991	33. A registered practitioner files an application on the client’s discovery that adding silica to a  known  plastic  composition  containing  the  flame  retardant,  X,  results  in  increased  flame  retardance.    The  application  claims  a  composition  comprising  the  known  plastic  composition  containing X and also silica.  The primary examiner rejects the claim on the basis that applicant admits  that  X  was  a  known  flame  retardant  and  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  improved  flame  retardance.  In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP, a proper  reply  could  include  which  of  the  following  argument(s)  to  rebut  and  overcome  the  rejection?	6
992	34. In accordance with the patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP , which of  the  following  paper  is  precluded  from  receiving  the  benefit  of  a  certificate  of  mailing  or  transmission under 37 CFR 1.8?	6
993	35. The sole claim in an application filed by A and having an effective filing date of June 5, 2002,  recites  an  electrical  signal  amplifier  comprising  a  plurality  of  germanium  transistors  connected together in a particular configuration.  The claim is rejected under 35 USC 103(a) as being  obviousness  over  a  primary  nonpatent  reference  publication  (Reference  P)  in  view  of  a  secondary  nonpatent  reference  publication  (Reference  S).    Reference  P  has  an  effective  date  of  April  3,  2002,  and  names  A  and  B  as  the  authors.

Reference P discloses an electrical signal amplifier including a plurality of silicon transistors connected together in the same configuration as  that  set  forth  in  the  claim.    Reference  S  discloses  a  signal  amplifier  employing  germanium  transistors connected in a configuration different from the claimed configuration.  The applicant does not deny that the references render the claimed subject matter prima facie obvious.  Which, if  any,  of  the  declarations  under  37  CFR  1.132  set  forth  below  should  be  sufficient  under  the  patent laws, rules and procedures as related in the MPEP to overcome the rejection? 	6
994	36.  An  application  naming  X  and  Y  as  joint  inventors,  filed  on  April  3,  2002,  has  a  single  pending  claim,  and  does  not  claim  the  benefit  of  any  earlier  application.    Which,  if  any,  of  the  following  items  of  prior  art  that  have  been  relied  on  in  various  rejections  of  the  claim  may  be  overcome  by  a  suitable  affidavit  under  37  CFR  1.131  in  accordance  with  the  patent  laws,  rules  and procedures as related in the MPEP? 	6
995	37.   The   specification   of   an   application   does   not   disclose   the   utility   of   the   claimed   composition.  In fact, the claimed invention is useful for shrinking a specific class of tumors.  In a  first  Office  action,  the  primary  examiner  has  properly  determined  that  the  claims  lack  utility,  and has rejected all of the composition claims under the first paragraph of 35 USC 112 as lacking utility.  Which of the following responses is in accord with the USPTO rules and the procedures of the MPEP for persuading the examiner that the rejection is improper? 	6
1010	2.  To  satisfy  the  written  description  requirement  of  the  first  paragraph  of  35  USC  112,  an  applicant  must  show  possession  of  the  invention.    An  applicant’s  lack  of  possession  of  the  invention may be evidenced by: 	7

1003	45.  A  patent  application  has  claims  1-10  pending.    Claims  1  and  7  are  independent  claims.    Claims  2-6  depend  directly  from  claim  1  while  claims  8-10  depend  directly  from  claim  7.    Claims  1-10  have  been  twice  rejected  by  the  primary  examiner  under  35  USC  103(a)  as  being  unpatentable over Smith patent in view of Jones patent.  The applicant has appealed the rejection to  the  Board  of  Patent  Appeals  and  Interferences.    In  the  brief  under  the  “grouping  of  claims”  section, appellant states that each of the claims is separately patentable.  In the arguments section of  the  brief,  appellant  separately  argues  only  claims  1,  4  and  6.    In  the  examiner’s  answer,  the  examiner disagrees with appellant’s claim grouping because all the claims present a similar issue of patentability.  The examiner states that the claims all stand or fall together as a single group.

1015	7. Paul, a registered patent practitioner and counsel for Superior Aircraft, Inc. (“Superior”),filed a patent application naming chief engineer Davis as sole inventor, and claiming a titanium and aluminum alloy designed for use in advanced gas turbine engines in aircraft.  The application described  the  alloy  as  having  unexpectedly  excellent  and  improved  room  temperature  ductility.    The application was filed with an assignment document transferring all right, title and interest inthe application to Superior.  During prosecution of the application, the examiner had an interview with Paul and Davis of Superior.  The examiner noted the existence of a prior art publication that disclosed  test  data  demonstrating  that  the  claimed  alloys  exhibited  poor  room  temperature  ductility,  and  stated  that  he  had  personal  knowledge  that  the  alloy  was  old  and  well  known.  Davis  agreed  with  the  examiner,  and  stated  that  such  information  was  “old  hat,”  but  that  they  overcame  the  ductility  problem  by  simply  resorting  to  a  3-step  process  of  microstructure  refinement.  Paul concurred and pointed to the fact that not only had they disclosed the process in the  application,  but  that  microstructure  refinement  of  alloys  to  improve  ductility  was  so  well-known  that  the  technique  was  even  taught  in  metallurgy  courses  in  college.
